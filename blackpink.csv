I understand the fandom, I understand the bliss it gives (being an otaku myself) but I wasn't into listening to that kind of music. Until Blackpink came. The first thing that struck me about them was how distinct their voices are from each other, and their individual beauty was also so uniquely different from each other. Was them being distinguishable a huge factor for their popularity? Did it become easy for a lot of people, k-pop fans or not, to get into them because each members are easy to remember?

Or should I just go to macau since it would be a much smaller venue compared to singapore. However, I am worried about macau since I have not tried it yet and chinese fans would most likely go there.

- “YG ENTERTAINMENT” is misspelled “YG ENTERRAINMENT” 
- the plastic bag that the hoodie came in has a label on it that says “BLACK PINH” 

In my experience, these are usually telltale signs of counterfeit websites. So, what is happening? Can anyone verify the legitimacy of that website? I assumed it is legit because it’s linked in the sidebar… My mistake i guess… 

Sidenote: the blackpink logo at the front of the hoodie is crooked but i chalk that up to shitty printing, which could happen with mass-produced clothing

I’ll start: 
I learned about them when my sibling recommended their Netflix documentary. At that time, I was just waiting for new k-drama shows to be released but there was nothing. So I bit the bullet and watched Light Up The Sky. I also wasn’t into kpop during this time. However, I IMMEDIATELY GOT HOOKED the moment their 1-on-1 interview showed up in the docu. There was something about their insights (about their trainee days, how they started, their future plans) that got me thinking: THESE FOUR LADIES ARE SPECIAL. I started listening to their music, watched a few interviews, and the rest is history! 

To watch them live in Bangkok really was a surreal experience to me. JenChuLiChaeng will always be special 🖤💖

68,68,BlackPink,Tutorial: How to register for BlackPink Presales for Mexico and Australia,"Update 3: BlackPink BornPink concert for Mexico, code are being sent out. Go check your email.

Update 2: Apparently codes for Australia are being sent out. It’s way earlier than NA/Europe where blinks got them literally 1 hour before presale starts. Check your email and all of its folders to see if you got your code. No code then, hopefully you get yours soon. 

Update: Presale registration for Mexico and Australia has ended. There was no ""BlackPinkLive"" link that was stated in their instructions. Maybe they have changed it and it's not required anymore? Hopefully that's how it is, and everyone that did apply for presale registration will get their unique code for presales. 

To get it out of the way, Mods if you think this does not need a dedicated thread, then you may delete it.

1. Make sure the email and phone number you're going to use to buy your tickets is exactly same as the one you've registered for your Weverse account.
2. If you haven't get your Weverse BlackPink Membership, get them now at the Weverse Global Shop. Cost is about $23USD. For Payment use PayPal.  If you don't have a Weverse account create one and enter your real info where necessary.
3. When your Weverse BlackPink Membership is successful, you'll see a digital membership card in your Weverse account. The card will have your real full name (provided that you did, for step 2) and a unique ID.
4. Go to BlackPink notification section and select the city you want to attend the concert. For Mexico, click on the Mexico one, and for Australia click on the Australia one.
5. Read the instruction carefully, read it twice if you have to. Do it in the correct order it tells you to. Then at the very bottom of that page, there is a link that says ""Register for the Fanclub Presale"", click on it.
6. Agree to the 3 additional terms and then click Apply
7. If step 6 is successful, then under My Events, you'll see a message that says ""Applied"" ""Membership Presales apply for BlackPink World Tour \[BornPink\] Australia or Mexico. Along with that  you'll see your email address, your Membership number, and a QR code.
8. Steps 5-7 is just part 1 of your presale registration. For part 2, somehow the link isn't anywhere on the Weverse page. During the US and Europe presales, part 2 of the link was directly under the link listed in step 5. Clicking on the 2nd link will take you to BlackPinkLive US or BlackPinkLive Europe. If you manually go to BlackPinkLive right now, it will take you to the US website, this will not work for Mexico or Australia. They will need their own dedicated links. It's also possible they may have changed how presale registration works, but the instruction did specify go to ""BlackPink Live"" \[Hyperlink\]. So check periodically to see if they provide the link or not.
9. When Weverse update and provides the link to the specified countries you want to attend the concert, then click on the specified link and then answer a mini questionnaire that's provided in that page. Along with that, you'll also need to enter any necessary information they require. I believe one of them is your phone number.
10. After you've done step 9, you'll get a text message from the tour provider and a presale verification number. enter the verification on the BlackPink live site.
11. After entering your verification code, it be taken to another page where  it says your presale registration is successful, along with a shorten url link that you can share your great news with everyone on social media.
12. For Step 10, you may also get another text message from an agency. For the US it was AEG Presents. The messae they  sent was Press Y to receive presale, and offers from your favorite artists. So agree to receiver your presale and offers. It's a possibility that you may have to press Y in order receive your presale code.
13. If everything is all done correctly then on the day of the presales about 1 hour before it's time to buy your tickets, you'll get a text message along with an e-mail with your unique presale code.",0.96,tutorial register blackpink presales mexico australia update blackpink bornpink concert mexico code sent check email update apparently codes australia sent earlier europe blinks literally hour presale starts check email folders code code hopefully soon update presale registration mexico australia ended blackpinklive link stated instructions maybe changed required anymore hopefully everyone apply presale registration unique code presales mods think need dedicated thread delete make sure email phone number going tickets exactly registered weverse account weverse blackpink membership weverse global shop cost payment paypal weverse account create enter real info necessary weverse blackpink membership successful digital membership card weverse account card real full name provided step unique blackpink notification section select city want attend concert mexico click mexico australia click australia read instruction carefully read twice correct order tells bottom page link says register fanclub presale click agree additional terms click apply step successful events message says applied membership presales apply blackpink world tour bornpink australia mexico along email address membership number code steps part presale registration part somehow link anywhere weverse page europe presales part link directly link listed step clicking link take blackpinklive blackpinklive europe manually blackpinklive right take website work mexico australia need dedicated links also possible changed presale registration works instruction specify blackpink live hyperlink check periodically provide link weverse update provides link specified countries want attend concert click specified link answer mini questionnaire provided page along also need enter necessary information require believe phone number done step text message tour provider presale verification number enter verification blackpink live site entering verification code taken another page says presale registration successful along shorten link share great news everyone social media step also another text message agency presents messae sent press receive presale offers favorite artists agree receiver presale offers possibility press order receive presale code everything done correctly presales hour time tickets text message along mail unique presale code

Was she actually interested in music and just failed to mention it? Does she also like to perform? Or is that really all of  what we know about her (and I'll be at peace if its so)?

161,161,BlackPink,260123 Allowed cameras during the Blackpink concert in national stadium SG?,"Hi, I know professional cams aren't allowed, like the ones with detachable lenses but do you guys have any idea if they will allow point-and-shoot cams in the stadium? Digicams? or are cellphones the only thing that's allowed? I heard that different venues have different policies.

I looked at Singapore Sports Hub T&amp;Cs and there it says:

*4.1 Flash photography is restricted.*

***4.2 Non-commercial photography is permitted at the Venue provided that the photographs are for personal use.***

*4.3 Video and audio recording devices including but not limited to camcorders and action cameras are prohibited. Tapes, films or other recordings may be destroyed.*

*4.4 Some Events, at promoter’s request, may prohibit the use of any cameras. Please visit the relevant Event page at* [*www.sportshub.com.sg*](http://www.sportshub.com.sg) *for specific information of the Event*

I checked the event page (as indicated in 4.4) but I found no info about the only type of cameras the promoters would allow. (also indicated in 4.3 are only the types that are prohibited.) I'm kinda hoping they would allow p&amp;s cams because of what's written in 4.2 but I just want to make sure.

What do you guys think? If any of you guys are gonna be there too, are u just gonna bring your phone? I got a VIP ticket so I really want to capture this once-in-a-lifetime moment!

Do I risk not being able to see and getting pushed over/out of the way by crazy blinks? (I'm 5'5) 

Do I need a clear bag and what should I bring in it? 

Should I try and make friends there?

What should I wear to be comfortable and not get cold/hot? (it's winter in June when the concert comes around)

241,241,BlackPink,"The discussion and worries of Yeji and Jyp himself for gg survival in K-pop industry make me think, ""Wow, Blackpink really made it "". Girl Groups"," 

It's fascinating to see such a popular idol openly discuss with her CEO of GG survival what kind of element it requires to always grow and stay at the top.

The discussion is:

"" We can be at the top instantly but can jump down in reputation with a single wrong move that doesn't appeal to fans' expectations.""

"" We have to admit that not everyone can survive this industry."" Look at your member and asked yourself, ""Can this person be successful by carrying her identity solo? ""

Now look at Blackpink:

\- At 8 p.m. on August 8, 2016, four members of different origins made their debut. The members are  
Jisoo, Jennie, Rosie, and Lisa.

Now look at what they achieved so far:

1. Born Pink world tour is expected to be the highest-grossing world tour by at least $200 million gross. 2nd highest will be the TLC fan Mail tour with only $72.8M.
2. Acquiring the top highest album sales with 2.5M+ album sales with a single album.
3. All 4 members of Blackpink become the top performing influencers defeating The Kim family with a total of $670M EMV.
4. Jennie solo: 800M+ views
5. Lisa solo: 1.2B+ views, 800k+ album sales
6. Rosie solo: 500M+ views, 600k+ album sales
7. The first K-pop group to surpass 1B views and 2B views.
8. Blackpink Spotify streams currently have a total of 8.6B+ streams.

Please remember that all of these achievements happened while Blackpink is moving into its 7th year in this industry. No matter how much criticism comes from all directions specifically directed at them but every single album they release makes them grow bigger at a very smooth pace, and we don't even see it slowing down a bit.

Every time I hear the word ""Blackpink,"" it sends chills as to see ""A History"" is carved bit by bit right in front of me, reshaping the girl group industry.

Tell me, how far can someone go in denial before acknowledging this history?

How much will the ""Blackpink legacy"" will be kept provided to be studied on how can future girl groups especially K-pop girl groups get inspiration on achieving great success by showcasing their unique groups' aura and individual influence by seeing Blackpink.",0.92,discussion worries yeji survival industry make think blackpink really made girl groups fascinating popular idol openly discuss survival kind element requires always grow stay discussion instantly jump reputation single wrong move appeal fans expectations admit everyone survive industry look member asked person successful carrying identity solo look blackpink august four members different origins made debut members jisoo jennie rosie lisa look achieved born pink world tour expected highest grossing world tour least million gross highest mail tour acquiring highest album sales album sales single album members blackpink become performing influencers defeating family total jennie solo views lisa solo views album sales rosie solo views album sales first group surpass views views blackpink spotify streams currently total streams please remember achievements happened blackpink moving year industry matter much criticism comes directions specifically directed every single album release makes grow bigger smooth pace even slowing every time hear word blackpink sends chills history carved right front reshaping girl group industry tell someone denial acknowledging history much blackpink legacy kept provided studied future girl groups especially girl groups inspiration achieving great success showcasing unique groups aura individual influence seeing blackpink

357,357,BlackPink,Do you think that BP will do anything different for the Coachella set in comparison to their standard concert show?,"Super stoked the Blackpink is on the lineup again!  I know I'll def be happy with anything they decide to perform, but knowing that they're a headliner this year and typically the production has to go above and beyond or I'm wondering if they'll do anything different esp since the audience of Coachella is so diverse and not everyone may have heard of BP before!  I'm sure there's also pressure too being first korean act AND first girl group AND being like one of the less than 10 female headliners in Coachella history (like Beyonce's performance was ICONIC) 

Their 2019 show, while I didn't see it in person looked amazing from videos so I'd imagine how amazing it'll be this year considering how much they've improved in the past 3/4 years.  But I'm not sure if they should copy 1:1 their concert set 

I know they'll def incorporate some fireworks, probs a few guests (maybe finally Selena Gomez or Lady Gaga? Or Dua Lipa again?!), but will Jennie bring back Solo again!? I think Solo fits the vibe of Coachella more than her new song but I guess we'll wait and see!

Sidenote: Also, looking at Coachella subreddit not good for the mental (although I know every year people have something to say about the lineup 🙄) so maybe that's why I'm hoping that BP's performance will prove all these negative nancy's wrong (and introduce them to how good Korean music is)!",0.98,think anything different coachella comparison standard concert show super stoked blackpink lineup know happy anything decide perform knowing headliner year typically production beyond wondering anything different since audience coachella diverse everyone heard sure also pressure first korean first girl group like less female headliners coachella history like beyonce performance iconic show person looked amazing videos imagine amazing year considering much improved past years sure copy concert know incorporate fireworks probs guests maybe finally selena gomez lady gaga lipa jennie bring back solo think solo fits vibe coachella song guess wait sidenote also looking coachella subreddit good mental although know every year people something lineup maybe hoping performance prove negative nancy wrong introduce good korean music

431,431,BlackPink,How to deal with unwarranted hate towards the girls?,"Hello! I am a DIVE (IVE fandom) and I was wondering do BLINKS have any advice for dealing with constant, unwarranted hate? I know BP gets a lot of hate for no reason, and a lot of the time it can be boiled down to plain misogyny. I see a lot of the same things happening now to IVE, specifically to Wonyoung and Leeseo. How do you deal with seeing so much hate towards the girls? Do you engage in arguments, or do you tune your feed to only show positive content? Do you think the hate will die down, or will I just have to live with it as a fan? It's really disheartening to see, especially considering the IVE girls have yet to do anything seriously troublesome and problematic imo. Thank you in advance, senior BLINKS &lt;3

EDIT: Thank you guys for responding! It feels like getting advice from an older sibling :) Here's what I learned:

1. Don't engage. Unless it's blatant misinformation, engaging is not going to change their minds.
2. The block/mute buttons are very easy to press and very useful LOL Cultivating safe spaces is the best thing to do for mental health in kpop.
3. No matter how many haters there seems to be, they will always have more fans than haters (and the streams/awards prove it.)
4. As long as I love the girls and support their music, that's all that matters!

This may seem very basic to a lot of people, but as someone who is unused to their favs getting a lot of hate, this is new to me. Thanks again, everyone :D",0.86,deal unwarranted hate towards girls hello dive fandom wondering blinks advice dealing constant unwarranted hate know gets hate reason time boiled plain misogyny things happening specifically wonyoung leeseo deal seeing much hate towards girls engage arguments tune feed show positive content think hate live really disheartening especially considering girls anything seriously troublesome problematic thank advance senior blinks edit thank guys responding feels like getting advice older sibling learned engage unless blatant misinformation engaging going change minds block mute buttons easy press useful cultivating safe spaces best thing mental health kpop matter many haters seems always fans haters streams awards prove long love girls support music matters seem basic people someone unused favs getting hate thanks everyone

So I recently came across some sellers on Ebay and Instagram selling these physical born pink superstar YG R cards. Each one is going for $45. Apparently it was from the Seoul concert or something and was like a lucky draw. However I know these R cards are usually VERY rare and go for hundreds. Has anyone heard of them giving out R cards at the Seoul concert or is this a scam? The seller has high ratings and on Instagram has a lot of proofs.",0.85,physical superstar born pink card scam real everyone recently came across sellers ebay instagram selling physical born pink superstar cards going apparently seoul concert something like lucky draw however know cards usually rare hundreds anyone heard giving cards seoul concert scam seller high ratings instagram proofs

511,511,BlackPink,230604 - Help finding 2 tickets to Osaka June 4th show.,"Hi all,

My friend and I are from Sydney and had been planning to pick up Sydney tickets once they went on sale.

After plane tickets went on crazy sale, we booked a Japan trip which overlaps with the Sydney date!

We do have a chance of catching BLACKPINK in Osaka on June 4th, but we don't have any experience buying tickets for Japanese events.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I am fully aware that we may have to pay resale price, but it's BLACKPINK and we don't want to miss them regardless.

Thank you for your help! :)",0.84,help finding tickets osaka june show friend sydney planning pick sydney tickets went sale plane tickets went crazy sale booked japan trip overlaps sydney date chance catching blackpink osaka june experience buying tickets japanese events advice would greatly appreciated fully aware resale price blackpink want miss regardless thank help

616,616,BlackPink,Any advice on concert etiquette?💕,"I'm going to the Berlin concert on the 20th, and it is going to be my first concert ever (I know, starting out big)!! Since I've never experienced anything like this, I don't exactly know how early I'm supposed to be there etc.
I have a seating ticket (Ticketmaster calls it a ""platinum ticket"" but I don't think it's any different from a regular one) so quequeing for a spot is not necessary, but I'm also assuming arriving 5 minutes before the concert starts is not ideal either.

So experienced blinks, if you also have any other advice not necessarily relating to this that could also be useful, let me know!",0.94,advice concert etiquette going berlin concert going first concert ever know starting since never experienced anything like exactly know early supposed seating ticket ticketmaster calls platinum ticket think different regular quequeing spot necessary also assuming arriving minutes concert starts ideal either experienced blinks also advice necessarily relating could also useful know

658,658,BlackPink,Main stage or secondary stage,"Would love to hear everyone’s experience being at either the main stage, runway or the secondary stage. What did you like/dislike? Are you able to see the main stage well enough from the secondary stage? Which one gets more crowded initially?


From what I gather they perform the following at each stage:
* main stage: HYLT, Pretty Savage, Whistle, KTL, Crazy over You, Pink Venom, Shut Down, Typa Girl
* partially main stage and partially secondary stage: DKWTD, Lovesick girls, Playing with Fire, Tally, all the solos, D4, Forever Young, encores

The other considerations are that the barricade at the secondary stage is closer to the stage than the primary stage and they seem to interact a bit more with fans at the secondary stage because of this.

From past concerts, it’s obviously not as fun when you’re at the main stage and you have to turn around to see the artist perform at the other stage. So I guess, the question becomes if you can see the main stage well enough from the secondary stage. I would say my favorite songs are DKWTD, Playing with Fire, Whistle and LSG, so I am leaning secondary stage.

I have VIP1 for Berlin so hopefully, I can get either first or second row 🤞🏾",0.96,main stage secondary stage would love hear everyone experience either main stage runway secondary stage like dislike able main stage well enough secondary stage gets crowded initially gather perform following stage main stage hylt pretty savage whistle crazy pink venom shut typa girl partially main stage partially secondary stage dkwtd lovesick girls playing fire tally solos forever young encores considerations barricade secondary stage closer stage primary stage seem interact fans secondary stage past concerts obviously main stage turn around artist perform stage guess question becomes main stage well enough secondary stage would favorite songs dkwtd playing fire whistle leaning secondary stage berlin hopefully either first second

It must be weird to not be able to do everything you want to do because people will recognise you.
You have to go around the city in a car all the time. You can only go to ""fancy"" places because that's the only place where you'll be able to eat without being interrupted. I imagine they just eat in their hotel rooms because that less of a hassle.

Was looking at Amazon and discovered just over a month later the vinyl is being released globally, in different colours from black to clear and for about 25% cheaper than the pre order price (for me at least).
