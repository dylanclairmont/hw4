I go to Amazon and other sites and I see a huge difference in prices so I have no clue which one to buy. How convenient is to buy it directly at the concert?

Also, anyone has had any problems with their lightstick at the airport?

Thanks a lot!"

68,BlackPink,Tutorial: How to register for BlackPink Presales for Mexico and Australia,"Update 3: BlackPink BornPink concert for Mexico, code are being sent out. Go check your email.

Update 2: Apparently codes for Australia are being sent out. It‚Äôs way earlier than NA/Europe where blinks got them literally 1 hour before presale starts. Check your email and all of its folders to see if you got your code. No code then, hopefully you get yours soon. 

Update: Presale registration for Mexico and Australia has ended. There was no ""BlackPinkLive"" link that was stated in their instructions. Maybe they have changed it and it's not required anymore? Hopefully that's how it is, and everyone that did apply for presale registration will get their unique code for presales. 

To get it out of the way, Mods if you think this does not need a dedicated thread, then you may delete it.

1. Make sure the email and phone number you're going to use to buy your tickets is exactly same as the one you've registered for your Weverse account.
2. If you haven't get your Weverse BlackPink Membership, get them now at the Weverse Global Shop. Cost is about $23USD. For Payment use PayPal.  If you don't have a Weverse account create one and enter your real info where necessary.
3. When your Weverse BlackPink Membership is successful, you'll see a digital membership card in your Weverse account. The card will have your real full name (provided that you did, for step 2) and a unique ID.
4. Go to BlackPink notification section and select the city you want to attend the concert. For Mexico, click on the Mexico one, and for Australia click on the Australia one.
5. Read the instruction carefully, read it twice if you have to. Do it in the correct order it tells you to. Then at the very bottom of that page, there is a link that says ""Register for the Fanclub Presale"", click on it.
6. Agree to the 3 additional terms and then click Apply
7. If step 6 is successful, then under My Events, you'll see a message that says ""Applied"" ""Membership Presales apply for BlackPink World Tour \[BornPink\] Australia or Mexico. Along with that  you'll see your email address, your Membership number, and a QR code.
8. Steps 5-7 is just part 1 of your presale registration. For part 2, somehow the link isn't anywhere on the Weverse page. During the US and Europe presales, part 2 of the link was directly under the link listed in step 5. Clicking on the 2nd link will take you to BlackPinkLive US or BlackPinkLive Europe. If you manually go to BlackPinkLive right now, it will take you to the US website, this will not work for Mexico or Australia. They will need their own dedicated links. It's also possible they may have changed how presale registration works, but the instruction did specify go to ""BlackPink Live"" \[Hyperlink\]. So check periodically to see if they provide the link or not.
9. When Weverse update and provides the link to the specified countries you want to attend the concert, then click on the specified link and then answer a mini questionnaire that's provided in that page. Along with that, you'll also need to enter any necessary information they require. I believe one of them is your phone number.
10. After you've done step 9, you'll get a text message from the tour provider and a presale verification number. enter the verification on the BlackPink live site.
11. After entering your verification code, it be taken to another page where  it says your presale registration is successful, along with a shorten url link that you can share your great news with everyone on social media.
12. For Step 10, you may also get another text message from an agency. For the US it was AEG Presents. The messae they  sent was Press Y to receive presale, and offers from your favorite artists. So agree to receiver your presale and offers. It's a possibility that you may have to press Y in order receive your presale code.

I looked at Singapore Sports Hub T&amp;Cs and there it says:

*4.1 Flash photography is restricted.*

***4.2 Non-commercial photography is permitted at the Venue provided that the photographs are for personal use.***

*4.3 Video and audio recording devices including but not limited to camcorders and action cameras are prohibited. Tapes, films or other recordings may be destroyed.*

*4.4 Some Events, at promoter‚Äôs request, may prohibit the use of any cameras. Please visit the relevant Event page at* [*www.sportshub.com.sg*](http://www.sportshub.com.sg) *for specific information of the Event*

I checked the event page (as indicated in 4.4) but I found no info about the only type of cameras the promoters would allow. (also indicated in 4.3 are only the types that are prohibited.) I'm kinda hoping they would allow p&amp;s cams because of what's written in 4.2 but I just want to make sure.

241,BlackPink,"The discussion and worries of Yeji and Jyp himself for gg survival in K-pop industry make me think, ""Wow, Blackpink really made it "". Girl Groups"," 

It's fascinating to see such a popular idol openly discuss with her CEO of GG survival what kind of element it requires to always grow and stay at the top.

The discussion is:

"" We can be at the top instantly but can jump down in reputation with a single wrong move that doesn't appeal to fans' expectations.""

"" We have to admit that not everyone can survive this industry."" Look at your member and asked yourself, ""Can this person be successful by carrying her identity solo? ""

Now look at Blackpink:

\- At 8 p.m. on August 8, 2016, four members of different origins made their debut. The members are  
Jisoo, Jennie, Rosie, and Lisa.

Now look at what they achieved so far:

1. Born Pink world tour is expected to be the highest-grossing world tour by at least $200 million gross. 2nd highest will be the TLC fan Mail tour with only $72.8M.
2. Acquiring the top highest album sales with 2.5M+ album sales with a single album.
3. All 4 members of Blackpink become the top performing influencers defeating The Kim family with a total of $670M EMV.
4. Jennie solo: 800M+ views
5. Lisa solo: 1.2B+ views, 800k+ album sales
6. Rosie solo: 500M+ views, 600k+ album sales
7. The first K-pop group to surpass 1B views and 2B views.
8. Blackpink Spotify streams currently have a total of 8.6B+ streams.

Please remember that all of these achievements happened while Blackpink is moving into its 7th year in this industry. No matter how much criticism comes from all directions specifically directed at them but every single album they release makes them grow bigger at a very smooth pace, and we don't even see it slowing down a bit.

Every time I hear the word ""Blackpink,"" it sends chills as to see ""A History"" is carved bit by bit right in front of me, reshaping the girl group industry.

Tell me, how far can someone go in denial before acknowledging this history?

How much will the ""Blackpink legacy"" will be kept provided to be studied on how can future girl groups especially K-pop girl groups get inspiration on achieving great success by showcasing their unique groups' aura and individual influence by seeing Blackpink.",0.92,"The discussion and worries of Yeji and Jyp himself for gg survival in K-pop industry make me think, ""Wow, Blackpink really made it "".

272,BlackPink,Will any of the Pinks be attending Paris Fashion Week scheduled through the 17th-22nd?,I was wondering if there was any confirmation on whether the Pinks would be attending Paris Fashion week? I believe it‚Äôs scheduled from January 17th-22nd. Today is the 17th so I was wondering if they‚Äôd attend before the 20th which is when their Riyadh Born Pink concert is. Maybe they‚Äôll perform at Riyadh then go to Paris? I‚Äôm not sure what the show schedules are for their respective fashion house.,0.89,Will any of the Pinks be attending Paris Fashion Week scheduled through the 17th-22nd?

357,BlackPink,Do you think that BP will do anything different for the Coachella set in comparison to their standard concert show?,"Super stoked the Blackpink is on the lineup again!  I know I'll def be happy with anything they decide to perform, but knowing that they're a headliner this year and typically the production has to go above and beyond or I'm wondering if they'll do anything different esp since the audience of Coachella is so diverse and not everyone may have heard of BP before!  I'm sure there's also pressure too being first korean act AND first girl group AND being like one of the less than 10 female headliners in Coachella history (like Beyonce's performance was ICONIC) 

Their 2019 show, while I didn't see it in person looked amazing from videos so I'd imagine how amazing it'll be this year considering how much they've improved in the past 3/4 years.  But I'm not sure if they should copy 1:1 their concert set 

I know they'll def incorporate some fireworks, probs a few guests (maybe finally Selena Gomez or Lady Gaga? Or Dua Lipa again?!), but will Jennie bring back Solo again!? I think Solo fits the vibe of Coachella more than her new song but I guess we'll wait and see!

Sidenote: Also, looking at Coachella subreddit not good for the mental (although I know every year people have something to say about the lineup üôÑ) so maybe that's why I'm hoping that BP's performance will prove all these negative nancy's wrong (and introduce them to how good Korean music is)!",0.98,"Do you think that BP will do anything different for the Coachella set in comparison to their standard concert show?

431,BlackPink,How to deal with unwarranted hate towards the girls?,"Hello! I am a DIVE (IVE fandom) and I was wondering do BLINKS have any advice for dealing with constant, unwarranted hate? I know BP gets a lot of hate for no reason, and a lot of the time it can be boiled down to plain misogyny. I see a lot of the same things happening now to IVE, specifically to Wonyoung and Leeseo. How do you deal with seeing so much hate towards the girls? Do you engage in arguments, or do you tune your feed to only show positive content? Do you think the hate will die down, or will I just have to live with it as a fan? It's really disheartening to see, especially considering the IVE girls have yet to do anything seriously troublesome and problematic imo. Thank you in advance, senior BLINKS &lt;3

EDIT: Thank you guys for responding! It feels like getting advice from an older sibling :) Here's what I learned:

1. Don't engage. Unless it's blatant misinformation, engaging is not going to change their minds.
2. The block/mute buttons are very easy to press and very useful LOL Cultivating safe spaces is the best thing to do for mental health in kpop.
3. No matter how many haters there seems to be, they will always have more fans than haters (and the streams/awards prove it.)
4. As long as I love the girls and support their music, that's all that matters!

This may seem very basic to a lot of people, but as someone who is unused to their favs getting a lot of hate, this is new to me.

After plane tickets went on crazy sale, we booked a Japan trip which overlaps with the Sydney date!

We do have a chance of catching BLACKPINK in Osaka on June 4th, but we don't have any experience buying tickets for Japanese events.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I am fully aware that we may have to pay resale price, but it's BLACKPINK and we don't want to miss them regardless.

616,BlackPink,Any advice on concert etiquette?üíï,"I'm going to the Berlin concert on the 20th, and it is going to be my first concert ever (I know, starting out big)!! Since I've never experienced anything like this, I don't exactly know how early I'm supposed to be there etc.
I have a seating ticket (Ticketmaster calls it a ""platinum ticket"" but I don't think it's any different from a regular one) so quequeing for a spot is not necessary, but I'm also assuming arriving 5 minutes before the concert starts is not ideal either.

So experienced blinks, if you also have any other advice not necessarily relating to this that could also be useful, let me know!",0.94,"Any advice on concert etiquette?üíï I'm going to the Berlin concert on the 20th, and it is going to be my first concert ever (I know, starting out big)!!

From what I gather they perform the following at each stage:
* main stage: HYLT, Pretty Savage, Whistle, KTL, Crazy over You, Pink Venom, Shut Down, Typa Girl
* partially main stage and partially secondary stage: DKWTD, Lovesick girls, Playing with Fire, Tally, all the solos, D4, Forever Young, encores

The other considerations are that the barricade at the secondary stage is closer to the stage than the primary stage and they seem to interact a bit more with fans at the secondary stage because of this.

From past concerts, it‚Äôs obviously not as fun when you‚Äôre at the main stage and you have to turn around to see the artist perform at the other stage. So I guess, the question becomes if you can see the main stage well enough from the secondary stage. I would say my favorite songs are DKWTD, Playing with Fire, Whistle and LSG, so I am leaning secondary stage.

It must be weird to not be able to do everything you want to do because people will recognise you.
You have to go around the city in a car all the time. You can only go to ""fancy"" places because that's the only place where you'll be able to eat without being interrupted. I imagine they just eat in their hotel rooms because that less of a hassle.

I'm wondering if anyone got a clip of this interaction? I was freaking out and didn't have my phone out to record or take pictures. Thank you in advance!",0.98,"221120 Born Pink LA day 2 soundcheck help!! Hi guys!

953,BlackPink,tour merch shipping help!,"Hi blinks!! 

I really want the ""born pink trading cards"" set from their tour merch and it's gone on pre-orders on their website [https://shop.blackpinkmusic.com/products/born-pink-trading-cards](https://shop.blackpinkmusic.com/products/born-pink-trading-cards).

Does anyone know if this website will ship to India? If so then what's the shipping and customs like? 

I tried going until checkout and shipping showed it was about $4 but i'm very skeptical because $4 seems to cheap for India shipping (i mean literally no website ships to us, including weverse/ktwon4u).",1.0,"tour merch shipping help! Hi blinks!!

I was watching this random [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjpZAW5jpLI) which i never seen of Kim Jennie and I got surprised when I saw her walking in a parking garage. I really like the asthetic of the video, and I would wish to watch it entirely. The clip I am saying starts from 0:05 to 0:12. And it appears again in 1:03 to the end

If somebody can help me to find the full video, I would be very thankful.
