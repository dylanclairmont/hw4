3,NewJeans,Newjeans Danielle is severely underrated and underappreciated maybe,"I usually am a casual K-pop listener since 2020. Then I started to dig deeper and now I do have vast knowledge about the industry. And I have never felt the need to write posts on any K-pop idol(even though Lisa from BP was my ult at first) or related happenings.

But somehow Newjeans Danielle is/will be my ultimate favorite artist from K-pop for life ig. I don't choose bias on their looks. It's their whole aura that I have to like in order to choose 'the one'. And in my opinion, she has everything and I find her personality the most real one, her smile the most contagious one, and she has the most potential out there. She always gives her best. Honestly, I feel she is one of the idols teens should look up to.

But regardless, she is too underrated for the above to happen ;). Well, Hyein is talented too but bcoz people feel she is underage they avoid her fan cams and all but that's not the case for Danielle right! then why she is so underrated??

One example would be-Haerin has 1.3 million views on her ""Ditto"" fancam, whereas Danielle has only 247k. Criminally underrated, uffh!! Please give them equal love and priority guys.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT-All I wanted to say is that pretty much every fan cam of her has fewer views; Not just 1,2 or 3 or 4. That disparity was my reason to post this one. Some said she is well-loved and maybe she is but it doesn't reflect most of the time. And yeah Koreans don't usually prefer foreign faces that much but youtube is more of a global platform, so. I understand why some people seem to dislike my post. Sorry for offending you.",0.8,"Newjeans Danielle is severely underrated and underappreciated maybe I usually am a casual K-pop listener since 2020.

26,NewJeans,Favourite Fancams/Facecams of Debut Era of Each Member,"Fancams/Facecams r one of my favourite aspects of kpop. The way we can completely focus on an idol nd their performance skills, styling, expressions etc is excellent content for me. Also getting fancams for different stages nd outfits of each era is another thing I look forward to every era. 

What r ur favourite fancams/facecams of our girls individually??? What made those ur favourite?? 

For me - 

Minji - 1. https://youtu.be/e1SCPHJdLNU ; 2. https://youtu.be/p1cE9T0CFCQ

In the first fancam i love the MV outfits, they look fun nd chill plus minji just looks really handsome there. I know people typically call girls beautiful but handsome is a word I think suits minji well. The second fancam honestly is one of my favourites for the whole of the group. 

Hanni - 1. https://youtu.be/lmJPeFW75qQ ; 2. https://youtu.be/7g7Xw_uJ4XE.

Hanni is my bias nd I would have added a lot more fancams but i restricted myself to only 2 fancams per member. Anyway, for the first fancam - the smile at the start. That's it, that's enough reason. The way her face glows up when she performs is just sooo endearing to watch. For the second fancam, hanni nd glasses r a combo I need more of. She's just gorgeous here nd I loved these outfits in the mv so I'm glad they did a stage with these. 

Danielle - 1. https://youtu.be/D0x7KSdVWYs ; 2. https://youtu.be/he_kmGDIB-o

First fancam - Same as hanni, it's the smile for me. Danielle is like the sun, always glows bright nd happy and her smile just lits up every inch of her face. Seeing her happy makes us audience smile too. For the second fancam I love the stickers nd makeup for this stage on dani. She looks extra beautiful. Plus her expressions r always fun to watch. 

Haerin - 1. https://youtu.be/Mfd7euBZANI ; 2. https://youtu.be/fajvR2IjnRc

A cat stuck in a human body üê±,  that's basically haerin ü•∞. Nd the first fancam here is the best example to support that statement. The long black hair looks beautiful on her plus her expressions here r really captivating. For the second fancam, this is their first stage I watched nd I remember it making an impact on me. I used to go back to this stage nd fancams for quite some time. Haerin looks gorgeous here. 

Hyein - 1. https://youtu.be/P8CTQxfxoqo ; 2. https://youtu.be/lg6O00c0dGU

It's funny how for hyein i love her expressions even before the song starts in the first fancam. She looks sooo cute nd the styling suits her a lot. I go back to this fancam especially for the first part before the song starts. The second fancam was their debut stage one nd she mesmerized me with her performance skills. Hyein really has an X factor to her on stage. She's really commanding.

104,NewJeans,"Can we appreciate Hyein's ""Wooo oooOoh"" in Ditto","It's just absolutely flawless.
The way it sets the tone for the rest of the song, it's pretty iconic.

I know a lot of fans overlook her because of her age, but I honestly believe that Hyein is WAAAAAY more talented than what people think. 

Starting a career in the industry at such a young age, around 8 or 9, she's done MODELING, TV, COMMERCIALS, COMEDY, MUSIC, and she's only 14!

I always tell people, she has what it takes to be a TOP High fashion runway model, being 5'7 at 14, she probably still will grow a couple inches, even if she doesn't grow, her model walk is already A+. 

Her part in Ditto has sooo much emotion, her voice really captures you in. 
Watching the ""behind the scenes"", her voice barely needs any auto tune, like she's great. 

Hopefully she shows us more of her singing during her next comeback! 

I remember when DITTO first came out, and people kept saying the ""Wooo"" is maybe Danielle or Hanni, and all the line distribution videos on YouTube had to remake their videos once they found out it was hyein. 

Like when you hear Ditto, her part is literally the first thing any one listens to. 

I just wanted to take this time, to show some appreciation on how talented our little Maknae really is!

Don't SLEEP ON HYEIN!

She's only 14, imagine her voice at 18-19. 
She'll be unstoppable!

147,NewJeans,There are only 3 K-pop songs in the United States Top Songs Weekly (Youtube) and two of them are from... Is easy to chart on Apple music US?," United States Top Songs Weekly (Youtube) 

&amp;#x200B;

20. Twice - Moonlight Sunrise - 2.16M (NEW)

61. NewJeans - OMG - 1.43M (4 weeks)

100. NewJeans - Ditto - 1.04M (4 weeks)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, let's compare it with the numbers of the most successful K-pop girl group in the USA at the moment:

United States Top Songs Weekly (Youtube)  4th week:

15. GG -Pre-release (2022) - 2.46M

41. GG- Title track (2022) - 1.67M

61. NewJeans - OMG - 1.43M 

100. NewJeans - Ditto - 1.04M 

&amp;#x200B;

Can you all see that the difference isn't that big? Take into consideration that I'm comparing a nearly 7 years old group with a 6 months old group.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's talk about Apple Music Us:

It ain't easy to chart there. It took nearly 4 years for the first (and only) K-pop girl group to ever chart there with their own songs (their first entry was a collaboration with a USA pop star ). The same girl group has never entered the top 100 of the chart with solo group songs (without feats.) even though they are constantly reaching the top 5/10 of Spotify US. **Their solo group songs usually chart between 1/10 days inside the top 200 of Apple Music US and then... OUT.** Their only songs to do ""well"" were the feats with USA POP stars. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only girl group to ever chart at US AM peaks from their last two title tracks and pre-releases (solo GROUP songs without feats.):

Apple Music US - #117 (X - 2022) #3 - Spotify US

Apple Music US - #130 (X - 2022) #6 - Spotify US

Apple Music US - #127 (X - 2020) #24 - Spotify US

Apple Music US - #151 (X  - 2020) #8 - Spotify US

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm trying to say is... If a group can chart inside the top 5/10 of Spotify US but can enter the top 100 of Apple Music US with the same songs... why NewJeans needs to chart there when their songs are only charting inside the top 40/30 of Spotify US?

&amp;#x200B;

Even the biggest KPOP group of all time (The boy group) has very different numbers when you compare the two platforms which means that Apple Music isn't an easy place for K-pop artists.

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't use Apple Music  but I found this print from Jan 21, 2023  (APPLE MUSIC US):

159,NewJeans,How popular is NewJeans in America?,"I wanted to share with you guys something that really made me realize that NewJeans are going to get Big. Like real big. 

So a little background, I work retail, at a Clothing store in Los Angeles. And today I had two teenagers walk in, all around 17-18, they were looking at our clothes, and for some reason, something to inside me told me to ask if they listen to KPop..

So I did. We started talking, and I asked if they liked  NewJeans, and mind you, I'm in California, in Los Angeles, and after I asked, their faces LIGHT UP.

They go:

""OMG yes I bought the album, EVERY version""
Meaning she has ALL the versions, of each member.

She them proceeds to tell me that her Bias is Minji,
I told her mine was Haerin.

It just blew my mind. It's like, these are kids,, in America, and they were IN LOVE with NewJeans.

I can only imagine how kids are in South Korea, and all around the world.

It just made me realize, like NewJeans is WAAAAAY bigger than we think. 
I have a feeling they're guna be HUGE.

Like I've talked to other people, k Pop ISNT as popular as people think,

But for some reason, even people that are new to KPOP or have never listened to KPop before are in love with NewJeans.

They're a 6 month old group. Imagine how big they will be in a year or two.
It was just heart warming to see, that I met other people that share the love I do for NewJeans' great music.

It's like, once we figure out that we're both Bunnies, were automatically family !

""You like NewJeans, I like NewJeans. We're family""

Such a great experience. 
Like EVERYONE on this subreddit, has been super nice and helpful.
Everytime we have ""new"" people that ask questions,
We always welcome them with open arms.

3. Haerin is building up so much confidence and it makes her glow so much! I was rewatching their first few phoning live and she barely say anything. I dont think the world is ready for fully confident haerin!

4. The live support they get from the fanchant are amazing on these live shows, seems that they are building more solid fanbase locally! So jealous to those who can watch them live!

205,NewJeans,Is just me NewJans doesn‚Äôt really seem ‚Äúthat popular‚Äù ?,"That was my thought for a while. I traduce popularity normally based on views, dance covers , mentioning by the fandom and ‚Äúrealization by osmosis‚Äù about a group‚Äôs popularity. I don‚Äôt know anything about them, but I know for example that Stray Kidz are very popular, I see the Chan guy face on memes all over YT and they‚Äôre mentioned all the time plus the view count. Same with IVE or let‚Äôs say, Le Sserafim.

This didn‚Äôt happen with NWJNs. I discovered them in summer while searching for new kpop songs, I read ‚ÄúCookie‚Äù on the list and recognized the name because there were some covers with the title ‚ÄúNewJeans‚Äù (I thought that was the name of a song) . I was shocked by the sound and aesthetic of the video , and by the lyrics. The rest is history. They‚Äôre MY kind of group . But I didn‚Äôt truly believe the were that popular.

I keep reading all this achievements and such butin here but to me if I dont see 8/10 dan covers about you, people mentioning you all the time and +100 million views minimum I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre that popular.
IVE, Kepler, NMIXX ,  Aespa , Itzy all have hundreds of millions of views so i know they‚Äôre super popular. Im 24, im not on TikTok nor own spotify. So maybe is ‚Äúthe outlier bias‚Äù but it wasn‚Äôt until very recently that I truly truly felt NJs was was really really popular.

256,NewJeans,230121 Min Heejin Interview Full Translation,"**Cine21:** *NewJeans debuted with global attention and their 1st EP „ÄäNew Jeans„Äã was an instant hit. &lt;Ditto&gt; and &lt;OMG&gt; was proof against a sophomore slump and NewJeans drove home an even larger success through taking the top 3 spot on the charts as well as placing within the Billboard Hot100 within 6 months of debut. Looking back from right before &lt;Ditto&gt; was released to now, how does it feel?*

**MHJ:** There‚Äôs a lot going through my mind now. I‚Äôm not really the type to worry about superstitions. Right now, I‚Äôm getting ready for our next album. It‚Äôs going to be something completely new so I hope you all are ready. I remember the moments right before releasing &lt;Ditto&gt;. I thought my heart was going to explode. &lt;Ditto&gt; meant a lot to me, even on a personal level.

**Cine21:** *What do you mean?*

**MHJ:** As the title suggests, ‚ÄòDitto‚Äô was meant to build relatability and furthermore has the meaning of making up.

**Cine21:** *You strategized on announcing the pre-release &lt;Ditto&gt; and the single album „ÄäOMG„Äã pretty closely with the 1st EP „ÄäNew Jeans„Äã. One could say it was a pretty similar yet different strategy from releasing 4 songs and MV back to back without any introduction. Why did you decide to release one single at a time when you could have collected more songs for an EP or go straight to a full LP? I‚Äôm curious if this was related to the long term success of the first EP.*

**MHJ:** The idea behind this winter's record was pretty genuine. To give back. A response of sorts on the attention and love we received on the first project. So we led with a warm hearted song &lt;Ditto&gt;, opened a holiday pop-up, and decided to continuously donate a part of the record sale profits. We wanted to put together a package that felt like a Christmas gift and thank everyone for the amount of love they gave towards the 1st EP. It was cancelled due to Covid but originally the NewJeans members were planned to visit a children‚Äôs hospital on Christmas day as well.

**Cine21:** *Instead of Hybe‚Äôs producers, NewJeans music is being made by producers from BANA, a label that was founded by the former SM Ent employee Kim Kihyun. Why did you decide to work with BANA? I want to hear what the process of getting NewJeans‚Äô music ready was like.*

**MHJ:** The premise that I might be expected to work with HYBE producers sounds a bit weird. I think there‚Äôs a couple misunderstandings because ADOR started as a label within HYBE. To put it bluntly, ADOR is a company founded to allow Min Heejin do music and business the way she desires to. This also means that the company will be run differently from the pre-existing media industry systems. The mission of a company holds a lot of meaning. If someone asks how I‚Äôve been able to work 20 years in the idol industry even though I originally had no interest in it, you could say that it was the desire to provide an alternate vision and new music that doesn‚Äôt exist yet in the mainstream market. This is the reason I said that ‚Äú\[their\] concept is their music itself‚Äù right before the launch of NewJeans.

I am not a songwriter or a lyricist, just a producer that has nothing to do with copyright. The flip side of this means that I can do my work without being restrained by a song‚Äôs composition. This also means that ideally, Ador‚Äôs music is borderless and free of constraints. So working with those who understand my music tastes was much more important than creating an organized system. BANA‚Äôs Kihyun is an old friend from my SM Ent days. We became friends because we both did not agree with the company‚Äôs style and system at the time. I guess we were the troublemakers. And that‚Äôs also why we both left to create our own companies. When I launched ADOR under HYBE, I strongly argued for a complete ‚Äúlack of interference on creativity and our independent operations‚Äù. And as such, HYBE has no say or relation to how ADOR operates and runs production. So it feels weird when I sometimes see ADOR‚Äôs music style grouped with SM or HYBE.

BANA members and I have known each other for a long time. Kihyun in particular already knew why I was founding ADOR, my long term goals, and my music tastes so it was easy working with him. ADOR‚Äôs music does not rely on a single songwriter. As mentioned earlier ADOR was founded to realize my music and vision. So our organization and and the way we work is different from other companies. I collect music and decide \[their release\]. For instance, NewJeans‚Äô 1st EP was built from a library of demos I‚Äôve been collecting since before NewJeans was even put together. So a lot of the guesses on the songwriter‚Äôs intentions are all wrong. I share a lot of opinions with Kihyun in the process of collecting songs, finishing them, and working out their details. And then we work out the details like mixing, mastering, and vocal directing under my direction.

**Cine21:** *The fact that the music that a former creative director and now producer chose and released became one of the most widely successful music of the year means a lot. How do you interpret the music‚Äôs success?*

**MHJ:** There are a couple factors that I emphasize, such as melodic progression or vocal style. Personally, I have very much not been a fan of the way K-Pop typically handles melodic progression or vocal styles. The need to include a high pitched part, awkward and sudden rap sections, everyone sounding the same, etc. Of course, I do respect those who enjoy this style. But I do not like these elements and wanted a world in which music without those elements can exist. I started leading overall production in order to be in control of these details.

‚ÄòSongwriting‚Äô as a concept is fairly open-ended these days. It‚Äôs rare for a beat maker to also take on top lining and most don‚Äôt even recognize the concept of a top liner so most people don‚Äôt understand the role they play in making music so it‚Äôs understandable that most people fail to understand. The importance of a beatmaker versus a topliner varies song to song so I can‚Äôt say which is more important. And as such it‚Äôs arguable that the role of a director that manages this overall process has grown. All this means that a song isn‚Äôt made by one person. If you hear demo samples with different toplines on top of the same beat, I‚Äôm sure this will make a lot more sense. The outcome might have been very different if the beatmaker or the melody maker directed the vocals instead of myself. 250, who gained a lot of recognition through working with us, has always been a polished producer and has given music to other idol teams as well. But the output has been very different from ours. It might be obvious but the style of a final product changes depending on the final stakeholder‚Äôs decisions. A lot rides on my decisions. So word choice of asking how I ‚Äúchose‚Äù is right yet wrong. I‚Äôm someone that wants the change the game. I wanted to break the existing notion on how K-Pop can be successful. I became a producer and a CEO and yet I still desire to work in a creative environment that is free of prejudice. I hope lots of different thoughts appear in this market. This is coming from from a former art director that had no interest in idols. This should be your takeaway.

Typically, when something is successful, people like to look at the result and understand the process by going backwards. But there are serious limitations to this given that there is a finite amount of experiences to analyze and draw conclusions out of. The reality I experienced and have built is often very different from the 3rd person‚Äôs presumptive perspectives, because everyone works differently and approaches their lives differently. The title of Art Director, Creative Director, and Producers all meant different things per industry and per person. Never assume things with little basis. Things that feel new do for a reason. Using old conventions to understand newness could already be an outdated practice. One needs to think outside the box to think differently. Easily defining how success is made is not something every record producer is capable of. But if you must know how I think, I could say this. Perhaps it was the harmony of an attractive beat and melody paired with a easy to listen vocal with all the overwhelming aspects removed. There is a reason I wanted to be strong at the basics.

**Cine21:** *Lets talk about the MV story. There has bee a trend of adding lore or an overall narrative but this seems absent in NewJeans. Was this a deliberate move away from the way the K-Pop industry has been obsessed in lore? Or was this to give each album a different concept?*

**MHJ:** To summarize, I‚Äôm a person that is against K-Pop‚Äôs perspective on lore (laughter). NewJeans is a team that lacks the K-Pop element of lore. But one could argue that our message, which we have been sending pretty consistently, is a narrative of sorts. And if that‚Äôs how you understand us, that‚Äôs very welcome. I am a curious person by nature and I always look for fun. NewJeans albums will continue to state this similar message over different formats.

I‚Äôve read someone argue that they enjoy NewJeans for their lack of being complicated by lore building that K-Pop has been pushing as of recent. Of course, NewJeans has their own stories and concepts but they seemed to like that NewJeans was not hastily building a narrative, followed by the creator‚Äôs attitude of forcing symbolism and for the audience to analyze it. NewJeans seems to be the result of Min Heejin asking questions such as ‚ÄúWhat is a concept to an idol‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow do you build a story‚Äù and such. How did you reach a conclusion and apply them to your work?

It feels like the community has been rather sensitive on the ideal of a self driven, independent idol. But it‚Äôs ironic that they idealize this yet welcome lore that seem to treat them as characters. Aren‚Äôt these two opposing concepts? I have not been able to actually measure the effectiveness of what the K-pop community calls ‚Äòlore‚Äô (laughter) so even as someone who has worked in this industry for several years, I question whether we‚Äôre just overgeneralizing from the opinions of the select few. Several factors play a role in creating popularity so it‚Äôs difficult to measure the actual impact of what we call lore. Because of that, I had no reason the ‚Äòpush‚Äô for lore. NewJeans will adapt and provide a topic that is appropriate for each moment in time, as seen in how we released &lt;Ditto&gt; as an answer to the debut album last summer.

**Cine21:** *I heard that ‚Äòdeer in a snowfield‚Äô imagery in the &lt;Ditto&gt; MV was directly from you. What was reason? Personally it reminded me of &lt;Stand By Me&gt; and &lt;All That Heaven Allows&gt;.*

**MHJ:** When I first heard the intro to the &lt;Ditto&gt; demo, I was absolutely taken back by the chorus. It was as if it expressed everything I wanted to say. And a picture came into my head. A deer that randomly pops out in a white snow field and the faces of people who meet the unexpected. As if to represent the relationship between consumers and NewJeans who debuted out of nowhere. I was thinking of those who witnessed the beauty of freedom in an open, empty environment and their desire to own it. The desire to chase after something beautiful, while unintentional, puts constraints on the subject and ironically reduces their charm. I thought of this bizarre relationship and thought it‚Äôs similar to our reality. I understand people may not trust and question something they have yet to experience but I wanted to state that we will shine more brightly when we are left free. I even thought that that might be something that everyone actually wants. I collected &lt;Attention&gt; &lt;Hype boy&gt; &lt;Hurt&gt; &lt;OMG&gt; in 2019 but &lt;Ditto&gt; in particular was produced \[from my ask\] for the winter of 2022. Ironically, The misunderstandings from the 1st EP was what made &lt;Ditto&gt; happen. I wanted to wrap up the misunderstanding by reconciling \[TL note: she‚Äôs being very deliberate w her word choice. She‚Äôs not calling it a fight, she‚Äôs not saying she‚Äôs apologizing. She wants to make up for what‚Äôs happened and what‚Äôs happened is a misunderstanding\]. As if we could transfer the heat of the summer to the warmth of the winter. So I was even more sure that I wanted to build an album that felt like a gift.

**Cine21:** *I heard that you gave director Shin Wooseok complete creative control. Is this how you approach all your work? If there are parts that you are more involved in versus not, I‚Äôm curious how you decide which is which.*

**MHJ:** The way I work is always different for each project. When I was on &lt;You Quiz on the Block&gt; two years ago, I saw the episode with Dolphiner Films Director Shin Wooseok. I felt like the way he approaches work and sees the market is similar to me. As in, he was not fantasizing about the media industry, he had strong beliefs, he worked without borders, etc. Of course, I wasn‚Äôt planning on working with him back then. While working on „ÄäOMG„Äã, I wanted to give a completely different impression than that of the 1st EP. In order to do that, I needed a completely different direction in the MV as well. And Director Shin came into my head. I wanted someone who had never filmed any K-Pop MVs and I needed a creative mindset that thinks without borders. After meeting with him, I was excited about his lack of interest in the K-Pop community and his unique work ethic. I still remember his first question when we held our first meeting after we decided to start working. He wanted to know the long term plan and the future direction of NewJeans. He said he needed to know the overall direction in order to figure out what story to tell. And I was so relieved. I can‚Äôt not be excited when I thinks something is important and someone asks that very thing. His work style and his thought process was very similar to mine as well. He‚Äôs someone that can do the A to Z by himself. And I know, better than anyone, that they do not need anyone else to interfere with their work. Most importantly, I wanted to something that I couldn‚Äôt imagine so I wanted to stay out of it. So I volunteered as assistant. I asked him to do everything he needs to and that I will support from every direction, whether it be costuming or other filming needs. I then briefed him on our mission, the context of this industry, the future direction of NewJeans, and the role of this particular album. And we discussed all of these for a while. We weren‚Äôt neccessarily just discussing the concept or the narrative. And this goes for the deer as well. I let him know that ‚ÄúAll I wanted was for him to understand the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô behind the impression I got. No need to be boggled down in the look and feel of it. I don‚Äôt want to buldoze over your thought process.‚Äù It‚Äôs not a specific order, but rather a producer‚Äôs ‚Äúwhy‚Äù could be a part of the concept or the inspiration. I think Director Shin did a great job with both &lt;Ditto&gt; and &lt;OMG&gt;. I wanted &lt;OMG&gt; to be considerably unique since &lt;Ditto&gt; is something that everyone would enjoy. And he delivered. I recall being surpirsed after reading the first scenario of &lt;OMG&gt;. The paradox of the K-Pop industry, the direction of NewJeans, both were well implemented.

The dance MV have a strong appeal of their own. I know that there is value to visual side of it so we made several dance MVs. The actual MV needs to hold a larger message and deliver something more. I wanted to say that there things that are more important than the view counts. I work with young children so this is something I honestly needed to do.

**Cine21:** *I‚Äôm curious about the leadership of Minheejin, as someone who decides on a direction, listens to her coworkers and draws a larger picture.*

**MHJ:** I talk with everyone involved about the ultimate end goal. I get rather specific about the plan and how we get there. Because I have a very clear plan on how I want to do my work. Same goes for the NewJeans members. I take a lot of effort in explaining what I want to do, what I want to say, and why this is important to us. In a way, this is more important than explaining a concept or a storyline. It‚Äôs building the right foundations. One of the essential roles I play is driving this directive such that those intentions show themselves as needed.

For instance, I argued for a specific style of choreo, an unconventional and freestyle style that‚Äôs different from the common idol knife choreography, way before NewJeans came together. ADOR‚Äôs performance director Kim Jooeun agreed with and understand my intentions well, and it‚Äôs all in the result. &lt;Hype Boy&gt; was an example where we received an initial draft and did a complete refresh. I re-explained the style we need and asked her to redo the choreo. I‚Äôm not a choreopgraher so I can‚Äôt ask for a specific move or detailed movements. I just do what I can to explain the mood and direction I‚Äôm looking for. And the result was great. It was a viral hit as a challenge, and we continued to collaborate. We went with the original draft for &lt;Cookie&gt; and &lt;OMG&gt; without editing them. Talented people just need a solid direction and support. Same goes for ADOR‚Äôs stylist Choi Yoomi. It‚Äôs easy working with her since we share similar perspectives. Maybe it‚Äôs because I built this label to work a little more comfortably. I work well when my mind is at peace. And that happens when I work with those that share similar values. Only then can I lead and tell them to follow me. Micromanagement has it‚Äôs time and place. It‚Äôs not an always or a never. Micromangement is often seen in choreography since many people are working together closely. To draw the best result, small details need to be explained and directions need to set. This isn‚Äôt easy since the other person has feelings. Everyone is different and best I can do is adapt to each situation and subject. Good results aren‚Äôt easy. Director Shin Donggul, who directed &lt;Hype Boy&gt; and &lt;Cookie&gt; used the expression ‚Äúmothership‚Äù. It sounded like consolation.

**Cine21:** *From SM Ent‚Äôs Visual and Art Director to Creative Director, to HYBE‚Äôs CBO, and now to ADOR‚Äôs leader. I imaging there was a process in learning how these roles differ. I wonder why you decided to become a leader and a executive producer after coming to ADOR. Business and production could‚Äôve been separately managed and yet you chose to do both; why?*

**MHJ:** I founded a label to be an executive producer and took the role of a CEO to be fully independent as an executive producer. Creativity is a field that requires close communication with business management. This doesn‚Äôt imply reckless spending behavior. Success in creativity within pop culture is measured by the numbers. This isn‚Äôt pure art. So to me, creativity and business have been on the same line of importance. It‚Äôs been 20 years since I‚Äôve been a part of this industry. I‚Äôve witnessed a lot of mistakes and mishap over those 20 years. If someone asks what I‚Äôve learned over these 20 years, it‚Äôs, ‚ÄúAh, that‚Äôs what I should avoid.‚Äù and ‚ÄúI should avoid that.‚Äù I‚Äôve witnessed plenty of conflict that arose from misunderstanding between creativity and business. Simply spending a lot of money without proper planning does not lead to good creative output nor business output. Many people use the phrase ‚ÄúHYBE funds‚Äù to explain everything, but it‚Äôs not an expression I agree with. Invested funds and actual label management strategy that utilize them is separate from HYBE and is fully under the label‚Äôs control, and furthermore I‚Äôve received a couple other investment opportunities of simiar value at the time from companies other than HYBE. I had several options at the time and regardless of the investor, my number 1 request was always ‚Äòcreative independence‚Äô and ‚Äònonintervention‚Äô, so it didn‚Äôt have to be HYBE. Then this leads to ‚Äòwhy I had to choose HYBE,‚Äô but I will stop here since that will lead to a completely different topic than this interview.

The 1st EP budget was not hastily planned at all. Lots of folks mentioned HYBE‚Äôs capital regarding the 4 MVs and their production budget. HYBE has no say over ADOR‚Äôs production plan or how the funds are spent, because we were promised autonomy in business management. Our budget is not too different from other companies or labels, because the production budget was planned from my experience with budgeting and market research. If anything, we were much more efficient given the amount produced. And sure, budget helps, but a lot of it doesn‚Äôt always lead to good results. I try my best to balance spending and creativity based on my experience in the field. And that‚Äôs one of the factors that allowed for a NewJeans to be paid so quickly. Account balancing is different for each company and is a top secret so not a lot of people actually know how they work. Maybe it‚Äôs because of this lack of understanding, but I saw a lot of people talk about how NewJeans were paid 2 months into debut. Some were confused between creative neighboring rights \[TL:no idea what this is\] and account balancing. Some were arguing that it was possible because we‚Äôre a part of a large company.

Given how rare this is in the industry, I don‚Äôt not understand. At least based on what I‚Äôve seen, nobody has been paid this quickly. But nobody has 3 debut title tracks. And nobody had all three enter the charts so quickly and stay on top for the long run. The market is changing so obviously there aren‚Äôt examples to compare us to and so I understand people are guessing. We didn‚Äôt pay NewJeans because we were nice, and it wasn‚Äôt because HYBE is big. It happened because the necessary conditions were met. To summarize, it happened due to a balanced budget plan, a triple title strategy, and the outcome of being successful pretty quickly. When I first decided on three title tracks, lots of people were surprised and said a lot of things, but I was able to make the decision because I was a producer and yet a CEO. Filming several MVs was also possible because I was a producer and a CEO. If you‚Äôre a producer, you need to understand that pop culture is not free from the numbers. I able to think about how to create those numbers and alternate solutions preceisely because I‚Äôm a creative and an administrator, not an administrator that has nothing to do with the creative side.

**Cine21:** *I heard that you had no interest in K-Pop or the idol industry when you were in school. What did you have trouble accepting while working within the K-pop industry? What were some industry wide practices that you wanted to ignore?*

**MHJ:** When I was in school, I had no interest in idol culture. If anything, I was a bit more on the critical side. I think that‚Äôs what allowed me to join this industry. To be honest I constantly ran into situations that were hard to accept while working. I don‚Äôt think it was just being angry, but more that it logically didn‚Äôt make sense. I can‚Äôt pick just one or two things. Perhaps I built this label to prove that those outdated practices or prejudices can be broken.

Because we‚Äôre talking about ‚Äòsomething that I couldn‚Äôt understand about this industry‚Äô, something recent comes to mind, even though it‚Äôs a bit off topic. People who talk about me as a successful fan or the theory that I am projecting my own past into the MV. Taking imaginative guess that‚Äôs far from the truth and assuming that they‚Äôre correct is already dangerous in itself. I felt pity when I saw people attacking based on those assumptions and couldn‚Äôt begin to understand where it started go wrong. Isn‚Äôt attacking somebody based on unconfirmed guesses actually just making up whatever reason to hate? It felt like I was witnessing this persistent dark side of the industry. It‚Äôs not limited to this recent incident, but it‚Äôs always a bit scary when I realize some people are too deep in idol culture beyond understanding.

**Cine21:** *Maybe it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre a producer that‚Äôs been getting a lot of attention, but you‚Äôve been receiving off criticisms from people who don‚Äôt understand the industry, and from a third person perspective, it feels like I saw you being over criticized pretty often. How do you feel about this. How are you managing all this on a personal level and as a CEO.*

**MHJ:** The idol industry as I understand is full of various contradictions and unique characteristics. It‚Äôs a complicated topic, but the idol industry is typically composed of trainees in their teens that peak in their early 20s. The industry is characterized by companies that find these underage trainees and train them. Because of this, prospective idols look for stability in management and fandoms desire that the most for the person they support. But it‚Äôs also true that due to this, fandoms maintain a hostile attitude towards these companies by default. Of course, there‚Äôs been many incidents and unsolved issues so I understand that there are criticisms. I imagine over criticizing and being excessively absorbed in the culture is the result of these unsolved issues that have just become characteristics.

My relationship with NewJeans, at the very least, is different from the stereotypical entertainment label to artist relationship. A new kind of relationship within the media industry. And I didn‚Äôt pop out of nowhere, I‚Äôve been in this K-Pop industry the last twenty years as content producer. I realize, however, that I can‚Äôt change everything overnight. It‚Äôs up to me to prove through my attitude and outcomes. It‚Äôs been 6 months since I launched NewJeans. My name‚Äôs on everything we do so I couldn‚Äôt slack off in any aspect. Content, TV appearances, ads, and marketing: I am consistently trying to do what I can do provide new direction and fix some of their respective issues. It‚Äôs a small thing, but NewJeans albums did not contain random assortments of photocards that are quite popular among idol fans. This is because I wanted people to buy our products for what they are, not because of marketing gimmicks. I was glad to see the excited response but I was also curious. One of the experiments I wanted to do while launching ADOR and NewJeans is how far I can get with just the basics. This is why we didn‚Äôt do a YouTube promo campaign. I wanted to compete with the foundations; music, choreo, and content. It‚Äôs easier to evaluate reality the cleaner your data is. And once you set that as your basis, it‚Äôs easier to decide where to go next.

If anything, they‚Äôre sweet consumers that are excited by photo cards. They move me. If this their attitude now, I‚Äôm wondering how excited they can be once I‚Äôm going all in. Just a random thought but I‚Äôm suddenly just very thankful. It‚Äôs fun creating content by bouncing back and forth between the fans. If you look at just my title, you could ask why a CEO is knee deep in all this work but my title doesn‚Äôt change what I do. If I need it, I make it and new things that are perhaps hard to explain. I wanted to create a new kind of relationship with our consumers. The reason I founded ADOR was to do something I enjoy. ‚ÄòFun‚Äô influences a lot. ‚ÄòFun‚Äô is the foundation of the ‚Äòentertainment‚Äô industry. And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm focusing on. And because we‚Äôre in our early days, I am indeed involved in leading a lot. But good results will serve a good reference point for people at ADOR.

\[There were three more paragraphs about MHJ arguing back at ppl who think she‚Äôs projecting too much of her in NewJeans. This is mostly the Korean twitter community so I'm going to skip it for now She‚Äôs collaborating with and helping NewJeans members become great artists, film directors dont get criticized for telling their stories when actors are a thing so really she doesn‚Äôt get what the fuss is. Also she likes music and film but has no clear preferences in style or genre. 250 gave her a rare LP from france as a gift.\]",0.98,"230121 Min Heejin Interview Full Translation **Cine21:** *NewJeans debuted with global attention and their 1st EP „ÄäNew Jeans„Äã was an instant hit. &lt;Ditto&gt; and &lt;OMG&gt; was proof against a sophomore slump and NewJeans drove home an even larger success through taking the top 3 spot on the charts as well as placing within the Billboard Hot100 within 6 months of debut. Looking back from right before &lt;Ditto&gt; was released to now, how does it feel?*

**MHJ:** There‚Äôs a lot going through my mind now. I‚Äôm not really the type to worry about superstitions. Right now, I‚Äôm getting ready for our next album. It‚Äôs going to be something completely new so I hope you all are ready. I remember the moments right before releasing &lt;Ditto&gt;. I thought my heart was going to explode. &lt;Ditto&gt; meant a lot to me, even on a personal level.

**Cine21:** *What do you mean?*

**MHJ:** As the title suggests, ‚ÄòDitto‚Äô was meant to build relatability and furthermore has the meaning of making up.

**Cine21:** *You strategized on announcing the pre-release &lt;Ditto&gt; and the single album „ÄäOMG„Äã pretty closely with the 1st EP „ÄäNew Jeans„Äã. One could say it was a pretty similar yet different strategy from releasing 4 songs and MV back to back without any introduction. Why did you decide to release one single at a time when you could have collected more songs for an EP or go straight to a full LP? I‚Äôm curious if this was related to the long term success of the first EP.*

**MHJ:** The idea behind this winter's record was pretty genuine. To give back. A response of sorts on the attention and love we received on the first project. So we led with a warm hearted song &lt;Ditto&gt;, opened a holiday pop-up, and decided to continuously donate a part of the record sale profits. We wanted to put together a package that felt like a Christmas gift and thank everyone for the amount of love they gave towards the 1st EP. It was cancelled due to Covid but originally the NewJeans members were planned to visit a children‚Äôs hospital on Christmas day as well.

**Cine21:** *Instead of Hybe‚Äôs producers, NewJeans music is being made by producers from BANA, a label that was founded by the former SM Ent employee Kim Kihyun. Why did you decide to work with BANA? I want to hear what the process of getting NewJeans‚Äô music ready was like.*

**MHJ:** The premise that I might be expected to work with HYBE producers sounds a bit weird. I think there‚Äôs a couple misunderstandings because ADOR started as a label within HYBE. To put it bluntly, ADOR is a company founded to allow Min Heejin do music and business the way she desires to. This also means that the company will be run differently from the pre-existing media industry systems. The mission of a company holds a lot of meaning. If someone asks how I‚Äôve been able to work 20 years in the idol industry even though I originally had no interest in it, you could say that it was the desire to provide an alternate vision and new music that doesn‚Äôt exist yet in the mainstream market. This is the reason I said that ‚Äú\[their\] concept is their music itself‚Äù right before the launch of NewJeans.

I am not a songwriter or a lyricist, just a producer that has nothing to do with copyright. The flip side of this means that I can do my work without being restrained by a song‚Äôs composition. This also means that ideally, Ador‚Äôs music is borderless and free of constraints. So working with those who understand my music tastes was much more important than creating an organized system. BANA‚Äôs Kihyun is an old friend from my SM Ent days. We became friends because we both did not agree with the company‚Äôs style and system at the time. I guess we were the troublemakers. And that‚Äôs also why we both left to create our own companies. When I launched ADOR under HYBE, I strongly argued for a complete ‚Äúlack of interference on creativity and our independent operations‚Äù. And as such, HYBE has no say or relation to how ADOR operates and runs production. So it feels weird when I sometimes see ADOR‚Äôs music style grouped with SM or HYBE.

BANA members and I have known each other for a long time. Kihyun in particular already knew why I was founding ADOR, my long term goals, and my music tastes so it was easy working with him. ADOR‚Äôs music does not rely on a single songwriter. As mentioned earlier ADOR was founded to realize my music and vision. So our organization and and the way we work is different from other companies. I collect music and decide \[their release\]. For instance, NewJeans‚Äô 1st EP was built from a library of demos I‚Äôve been collecting since before NewJeans was even put together. So a lot of the guesses on the songwriter‚Äôs intentions are all wrong. I share a lot of opinions with Kihyun in the process of collecting songs, finishing them, and working out their details. And then we work out the details like mixing, mastering, and vocal directing under my direction.

**Cine21:** *The fact that the music that a former creative director and now producer chose and released became one of the most widely successful music of the year means a lot. How do you interpret the music‚Äôs success?*

**MHJ:** There are a couple factors that I emphasize, such as melodic progression or vocal style. Personally, I have very much not been a fan of the way K-Pop typically handles melodic progression or vocal styles. The need to include a high pitched part, awkward and sudden rap sections, everyone sounding the same, etc. Of course, I do respect those who enjoy this style. But I do not like these elements and wanted a world in which music without those elements can exist. I started leading overall production in order to be in control of these details.

‚ÄòSongwriting‚Äô as a concept is fairly open-ended these days. It‚Äôs rare for a beat maker to also take on top lining and most don‚Äôt even recognize the concept of a top liner so most people don‚Äôt understand the role they play in making music so it‚Äôs understandable that most people fail to understand. The importance of a beatmaker versus a topliner varies song to song so I can‚Äôt say which is more important. And as such it‚Äôs arguable that the role of a director that manages this overall process has grown. All this means that a song isn‚Äôt made by one person. If you hear demo samples with different toplines on top of the same beat, I‚Äôm sure this will make a lot more sense. The outcome might have been very different if the beatmaker or the melody maker directed the vocals instead of myself. 250, who gained a lot of recognition through working with us, has always been a polished producer and has given music to other idol teams as well. But the output has been very different from ours. It might be obvious but the style of a final product changes depending on the final stakeholder‚Äôs decisions. A lot rides on my decisions. So word choice of asking how I ‚Äúchose‚Äù is right yet wrong. I‚Äôm someone that wants the change the game. I wanted to break the existing notion on how K-Pop can be successful. I became a producer and a CEO and yet I still desire to work in a creative environment that is free of prejudice. I hope lots of different thoughts appear in this market. This is coming from from a former art director that had no interest in idols. This should be your takeaway.

Typically, when something is successful, people like to look at the result and understand the process by going backwards. But there are serious limitations to this given that there is a finite amount of experiences to analyze and draw conclusions out of. The reality I experienced and have built is often very different from the 3rd person‚Äôs presumptive perspectives, because everyone works differently and approaches their lives differently. The title of Art Director, Creative Director, and Producers all meant different things per industry and per person. Never assume things with little basis. Things that feel new do for a reason. Using old conventions to understand newness could already be an outdated practice. One needs to think outside the box to think differently. Easily defining how success is made is not something every record producer is capable of. But if you must know how I think, I could say this. Perhaps it was the harmony of an attractive beat and melody paired with a easy to listen vocal with all the overwhelming aspects removed. There is a reason I wanted to be strong at the basics.

**Cine21:** *Lets talk about the MV story. There has bee a trend of adding lore or an overall narrative but this seems absent in NewJeans. Was this a deliberate move away from the way the K-Pop industry has been obsessed in lore? Or was this to give each album a different concept?*

**MHJ:** To summarize, I‚Äôm a person that is against K-Pop‚Äôs perspective on lore (laughter). NewJeans is a team that lacks the K-Pop element of lore. But one could argue that our message, which we have been sending pretty consistently, is a narrative of sorts. And if that‚Äôs how you understand us, that‚Äôs very welcome. I am a curious person by nature and I always look for fun. NewJeans albums will continue to state this similar message over different formats.

I‚Äôve read someone argue that they enjoy NewJeans for their lack of being complicated by lore building that K-Pop has been pushing as of recent. Of course, NewJeans has their own stories and concepts but they seemed to like that NewJeans was not hastily building a narrative, followed by the creator‚Äôs attitude of forcing symbolism and for the audience to analyze it. NewJeans seems to be the result of Min Heejin asking questions such as ‚ÄúWhat is a concept to an idol‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow do you build a story‚Äù and such. How did you reach a conclusion and apply them to your work?

It feels like the community has been rather sensitive on the ideal of a self driven, independent idol. But it‚Äôs ironic that they idealize this yet welcome lore that seem to treat them as characters. Aren‚Äôt these two opposing concepts? I have not been able to actually measure the effectiveness of what the K-pop community calls ‚Äòlore‚Äô (laughter) so even as someone who has worked in this industry for several years, I question whether we‚Äôre just overgeneralizing from the opinions of the select few. Several factors play a role in creating popularity so it‚Äôs difficult to measure the actual impact of what we call lore. Because of that, I had no reason the ‚Äòpush‚Äô for lore. NewJeans will adapt and provide a topic that is appropriate for each moment in time, as seen in how we released &lt;Ditto&gt; as an answer to the debut album last summer.

**Cine21:** *I heard that ‚Äòdeer in a snowfield‚Äô imagery in the &lt;Ditto&gt; MV was directly from you. What was reason? Personally it reminded me of &lt;Stand By Me&gt; and &lt;All That Heaven Allows&gt;.*

**MHJ:** When I first heard the intro to the &lt;Ditto&gt; demo, I was absolutely taken back by the chorus. It was as if it expressed everything I wanted to say. And a picture came into my head. A deer that randomly pops out in a white snow field and the faces of people who meet the unexpected. As if to represent the relationship between consumers and NewJeans who debuted out of nowhere. I was thinking of those who witnessed the beauty of freedom in an open, empty environment and their desire to own it. The desire to chase after something beautiful, while unintentional, puts constraints on the subject and ironically reduces their charm. I thought of this bizarre relationship and thought it‚Äôs similar to our reality. I understand people may not trust and question something they have yet to experience but I wanted to state that we will shine more brightly when we are left free. I even thought that that might be something that everyone actually wants. I collected &lt;Attention&gt; &lt;Hype boy&gt; &lt;Hurt&gt; &lt;OMG&gt; in 2019 but &lt;Ditto&gt; in particular was produced \[from my ask\] for the winter of 2022. Ironically, The misunderstandings from the 1st EP was what made &lt;Ditto&gt; happen. I wanted to wrap up the misunderstanding by reconciling \[TL note: she‚Äôs being very deliberate w her word choice. She‚Äôs not calling it a fight, she‚Äôs not saying she‚Äôs apologizing. She wants to make up for what‚Äôs happened and what‚Äôs happened is a misunderstanding\]. As if we could transfer the heat of the summer to the warmth of the winter. So I was even more sure that I wanted to build an album that felt like a gift.

**Cine21:** *I heard that you gave director Shin Wooseok complete creative control. Is this how you approach all your work? If there are parts that you are more involved in versus not, I‚Äôm curious how you decide which is which.*

**MHJ:** The way I work is always different for each project. When I was on &lt;You Quiz on the Block&gt; two years ago, I saw the episode with Dolphiner Films Director Shin Wooseok. I felt like the way he approaches work and sees the market is similar to me. As in, he was not fantasizing about the media industry, he had strong beliefs, he worked without borders, etc. Of course, I wasn‚Äôt planning on working with him back then. While working on „ÄäOMG„Äã, I wanted to give a completely different impression than that of the 1st EP. In order to do that, I needed a completely different direction in the MV as well. And Director Shin came into my head. I wanted someone who had never filmed any K-Pop MVs and I needed a creative mindset that thinks without borders. After meeting with him, I was excited about his lack of interest in the K-Pop community and his unique work ethic. I still remember his first question when we held our first meeting after we decided to start working. He wanted to know the long term plan and the future direction of NewJeans. He said he needed to know the overall direction in order to figure out what story to tell. And I was so relieved. I can‚Äôt not be excited when I thinks something is important and someone asks that very thing. His work style and his thought process was very similar to mine as well. He‚Äôs someone that can do the A to Z by himself. And I know, better than anyone, that they do not need anyone else to interfere with their work. Most importantly, I wanted to something that I couldn‚Äôt imagine so I wanted to stay out of it. So I volunteered as assistant. I asked him to do everything he needs to and that I will support from every direction, whether it be costuming or other filming needs. I then briefed him on our mission, the context of this industry, the future direction of NewJeans, and the role of this particular album. And we discussed all of these for a while. We weren‚Äôt neccessarily just discussing the concept or the narrative. And this goes for the deer as well. I let him know that ‚ÄúAll I wanted was for him to understand the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô behind the impression I got. No need to be boggled down in the look and feel of it. I don‚Äôt want to buldoze over your thought process.‚Äù It‚Äôs not a specific order, but rather a producer‚Äôs ‚Äúwhy‚Äù could be a part of the concept or the inspiration. I think Director Shin did a great job with both &lt;Ditto&gt; and &lt;OMG&gt;. I wanted &lt;OMG&gt; to be considerably unique since &lt;Ditto&gt; is something that everyone would enjoy. And he delivered. I recall being surpirsed after reading the first scenario of &lt;OMG&gt;. The paradox of the K-Pop industry, the direction of NewJeans, both were well implemented.

The dance MV have a strong appeal of their own. I know that there is value to visual side of it so we made several dance MVs. The actual MV needs to hold a larger message and deliver something more. I wanted to say that there things that are more important than the view counts. I work with young children so this is something I honestly needed to do.

**Cine21:** *I‚Äôm curious about the leadership of Minheejin, as someone who decides on a direction, listens to her coworkers and draws a larger picture.*

**MHJ:** I talk with everyone involved about the ultimate end goal. I get rather specific about the plan and how we get there. Because I have a very clear plan on how I want to do my work. Same goes for the NewJeans members. I take a lot of effort in explaining what I want to do, what I want to say, and why this is important to us. In a way, this is more important than explaining a concept or a storyline. It‚Äôs building the right foundations. One of the essential roles I play is driving this directive such that those intentions show themselves as needed.

For instance, I argued for a specific style of choreo, an unconventional and freestyle style that‚Äôs different from the common idol knife choreography, way before NewJeans came together. ADOR‚Äôs performance director Kim Jooeun agreed with and understand my intentions well, and it‚Äôs all in the result. &lt;Hype Boy&gt; was an example where we received an initial draft and did a complete refresh. I re-explained the style we need and asked her to redo the choreo. I‚Äôm not a choreopgraher so I can‚Äôt ask for a specific move or detailed movements. I just do what I can to explain the mood and direction I‚Äôm looking for. And the result was great. It was a viral hit as a challenge, and we continued to collaborate. We went with the original draft for &lt;Cookie&gt; and &lt;OMG&gt; without editing them. Talented people just need a solid direction and support. Same goes for ADOR‚Äôs stylist Choi Yoomi. It‚Äôs easy working with her since we share similar perspectives. Maybe it‚Äôs because I built this label to work a little more comfortably. I work well when my mind is at peace. And that happens when I work with those that share similar values. Only then can I lead and tell them to follow me. Micromanagement has it‚Äôs time and place. It‚Äôs not an always or a never. Micromangement is often seen in choreography since many people are working together closely. To draw the best result, small details need to be explained and directions need to set. This isn‚Äôt easy since the other person has feelings. Everyone is different and best I can do is adapt to each situation and subject. Good results aren‚Äôt easy. Director Shin Donggul, who directed &lt;Hype Boy&gt; and &lt;Cookie&gt; used the expression ‚Äúmothership‚Äù. It sounded like consolation.

**Cine21:** *From SM Ent‚Äôs Visual and Art Director to Creative Director, to HYBE‚Äôs CBO, and now to ADOR‚Äôs leader. I imaging there was a process in learning how these roles differ. I wonder why you decided to become a leader and a executive producer after coming to ADOR. Business and production could‚Äôve been separately managed and yet you chose to do both; why?*

**MHJ:** I founded a label to be an executive producer and took the role of a CEO to be fully independent as an executive producer. Creativity is a field that requires close communication with business management. This doesn‚Äôt imply reckless spending behavior. Success in creativity within pop culture is measured by the numbers. This isn‚Äôt pure art. So to me, creativity and business have been on the same line of importance. It‚Äôs been 20 years since I‚Äôve been a part of this industry. I‚Äôve witnessed a lot of mistakes and mishap over those 20 years. If someone asks what I‚Äôve learned over these 20 years, it‚Äôs, ‚ÄúAh, that‚Äôs what I should avoid.‚Äù and ‚ÄúI should avoid that.‚Äù I‚Äôve witnessed plenty of conflict that arose from misunderstanding between creativity and business. Simply spending a lot of money without proper planning does not lead to good creative output nor business output. Many people use the phrase ‚ÄúHYBE funds‚Äù to explain everything, but it‚Äôs not an expression I agree with. Invested funds and actual label management strategy that utilize them is separate from HYBE and is fully under the label‚Äôs control, and furthermore I‚Äôve received a couple other investment opportunities of simiar value at the time from companies other than HYBE. I had several options at the time and regardless of the investor, my number 1 request was always ‚Äòcreative independence‚Äô and ‚Äònonintervention‚Äô, so it didn‚Äôt have to be HYBE. Then this leads to ‚Äòwhy I had to choose HYBE,‚Äô but I will stop here since that will lead to a completely different topic than this interview.

The 1st EP budget was not hastily planned at all. Lots of folks mentioned HYBE‚Äôs capital regarding the 4 MVs and their production budget. HYBE has no say over ADOR‚Äôs production plan or how the funds are spent, because we were promised autonomy in business management. Our budget is not too different from other companies or labels, because the production budget was planned from my experience with budgeting and market research. If anything, we were much more efficient given the amount produced. And sure, budget helps, but a lot of it doesn‚Äôt always lead to good results. I try my best to balance spending and creativity based on my experience in the field. And that‚Äôs one of the factors that allowed for a NewJeans to be paid so quickly. Account balancing is different for each company and is a top secret so not a lot of people actually know how they work. Maybe it‚Äôs because of this lack of understanding, but I saw a lot of people talk about how NewJeans were paid 2 months into debut. Some were confused between creative neighboring rights \[TL:no idea what this is\] and account balancing. Some were arguing that it was possible because we‚Äôre a part of a large company.

Given how rare this is in the industry, I don‚Äôt not understand. At least based on what I‚Äôve seen, nobody has been paid this quickly. But nobody has 3 debut title tracks. And nobody had all three enter the charts so quickly and stay on top for the long run. The market is changing so obviously there aren‚Äôt examples to compare us to and so I understand people are guessing. We didn‚Äôt pay NewJeans because we were nice, and it wasn‚Äôt because HYBE is big. It happened because the necessary conditions were met. To summarize, it happened due to a balanced budget plan, a triple title strategy, and the outcome of being successful pretty quickly. When I first decided on three title tracks, lots of people were surprised and said a lot of things, but I was able to make the decision because I was a producer and yet a CEO. Filming several MVs was also possible because I was a producer and a CEO. If you‚Äôre a producer, you need to understand that pop culture is not free from the numbers. I able to think about how to create those numbers and alternate solutions preceisely because I‚Äôm a creative and an administrator, not an administrator that has nothing to do with the creative side.

**Cine21:** *I heard that you had no interest in K-Pop or the idol industry when you were in school. What did you have trouble accepting while working within the K-pop industry? What were some industry wide practices that you wanted to ignore?*

**MHJ:** When I was in school, I had no interest in idol culture. If anything, I was a bit more on the critical side. I think that‚Äôs what allowed me to join this industry. To be honest I constantly ran into situations that were hard to accept while working. I don‚Äôt think it was just being angry, but more that it logically didn‚Äôt make sense. I can‚Äôt pick just one or two things. Perhaps I built this label to prove that those outdated practices or prejudices can be broken.

Because we‚Äôre talking about ‚Äòsomething that I couldn‚Äôt understand about this industry‚Äô, something recent comes to mind, even though it‚Äôs a bit off topic. People who talk about me as a successful fan or the theory that I am projecting my own past into the MV. Taking imaginative guess that‚Äôs far from the truth and assuming that they‚Äôre correct is already dangerous in itself. I felt pity when I saw people attacking based on those assumptions and couldn‚Äôt begin to understand where it started go wrong. Isn‚Äôt attacking somebody based on unconfirmed guesses actually just making up whatever reason to hate? It felt like I was witnessing this persistent dark side of the industry. It‚Äôs not limited to this recent incident, but it‚Äôs always a bit scary when I realize some people are too deep in idol culture beyond understanding.

**Cine21:** *Maybe it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre a producer that‚Äôs been getting a lot of attention, but you‚Äôve been receiving off criticisms from people who don‚Äôt understand the industry, and from a third person perspective, it feels like I saw you being over criticized pretty often. How do you feel about this. How are you managing all this on a personal level and as a CEO.*

**MHJ:** The idol industry as I understand is full of various contradictions and unique characteristics. It‚Äôs a complicated topic, but the idol industry is typically composed of trainees in their teens that peak in their early 20s. The industry is characterized by companies that find these underage trainees and train them. Because of this, prospective idols look for stability in management and fandoms desire that the most for the person they support. But it‚Äôs also true that due to this, fandoms maintain a hostile attitude towards these companies by default. Of course, there‚Äôs been many incidents and unsolved issues so I understand that there are criticisms. I imagine over criticizing and being excessively absorbed in the culture is the result of these unsolved issues that have just become characteristics.

My relationship with NewJeans, at the very least, is different from the stereotypical entertainment label to artist relationship. A new kind of relationship within the media industry. And I didn‚Äôt pop out of nowhere, I‚Äôve been in this K-Pop industry the last twenty years as content producer. I realize, however, that I can‚Äôt change everything overnight. It‚Äôs up to me to prove through my attitude and outcomes. It‚Äôs been 6 months since I launched NewJeans. My name‚Äôs on everything we do so I couldn‚Äôt slack off in any aspect. Content, TV appearances, ads, and marketing: I am consistently trying to do what I can do provide new direction and fix some of their respective issues. It‚Äôs a small thing, but NewJeans albums did not contain random assortments of photocards that are quite popular among idol fans. This is because I wanted people to buy our products for what they are, not because of marketing gimmicks. I was glad to see the excited response but I was also curious. One of the experiments I wanted to do while launching ADOR and NewJeans is how far I can get with just the basics. This is why we didn‚Äôt do a YouTube promo campaign. I wanted to compete with the foundations; music, choreo, and content. It‚Äôs easier to evaluate reality the cleaner your data is. And once you set that as your basis, it‚Äôs easier to decide where to go next.

If anything, they‚Äôre sweet consumers that are excited by photo cards. They move me. If this their attitude now, I‚Äôm wondering how excited they can be once I‚Äôm going all in. Just a random thought but I‚Äôm suddenly just very thankful. It‚Äôs fun creating content by bouncing back and forth between the fans. If you look at just my title, you could ask why a CEO is knee deep in all this work but my title doesn‚Äôt change what I do. If I need it, I make it and new things that are perhaps hard to explain. I wanted to create a new kind of relationship with our consumers. The reason I founded ADOR was to do something I enjoy. ‚ÄòFun‚Äô influences a lot. ‚ÄòFun‚Äô is the foundation of the ‚Äòentertainment‚Äô industry. And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm focusing on. And because we‚Äôre in our early days, I am indeed involved in leading a lot. But good results will serve a good reference point for people at ADOR.

\[There were three more paragraphs about MHJ arguing back at ppl who think she‚Äôs projecting too much of her in NewJeans. This is mostly the Korean twitter community so I'm going to skip it for now She‚Äôs collaborating with and helping NewJeans members become great artists, film directors dont get criticized for telling their stories when actors are a thing so really she doesn‚Äôt get what the fuss is. Also she likes music and film but has no clear preferences in style or genre. 250 gave her a rare LP from france as a gift.\]"

Idk if it's like a sample from an old song, or I think, but I can't figure it out,
Please help haha 

I can't put my finger on it, 
So if anyone has any info, that would be great!

I know Oohyo (the woman that wrote Ditto) uses a lot of Sampling in her music, so I'm sure it is a sample.

By the way, a Sample is when you use or cut a portion of an older song and put it in your new song.

407,NewJeans,This is a random take on ongoing discussions about Hyein's age and her debut.,"IDK if this is a place for it, but I just want to have a conversation on this topic with other Bunnies. Also, dk if this take is popular or not, but here is my unasked take on fan's/ people's treatment of Hyein-

  
In the name of protection and making controversies out of her debut, at this point, people are just trying to minimize everything she has worked so hard for. I'm not saying that it's okay to debut young idols, but I think now is the time that she needs all the love for her hard work and professionalism that she puts towards her work. People just talk about how young she is and then disappear when it's finally time to appreciate her because ""it's so weird to stan a 14-year-old"". It is weird because you guys make it weird. There are plenty of healthy ways to support a child idol, and ignoring them constantly for their age is not one of them. By ignoring, I mean, how criminally underrated she is. I thought I was overthinking about this but then I recently randomly commented on a fanmade youtube content of NewJeans about her being underappreciated and it blew up. So I guess people do realise this is happening on a certain level.

  
Tell me what you guys think because this has been bothering me a lot when I read comments about Hyein anywhere, especially as I consider her to be my bias.   
PS. This is my first time posting on Reddit lol. Tell me if I made any mistakes. Kinda scared of this being taken down because of mistakenly infringing on some missed community guidelines.",0.89,"This is a random take on ongoing discussions about Hyein's age and her debut.

408,NewJeans,The Mysterious Connection Between OMG &amp; Ditto..,"I know that these theories have been talked about and discussed alot already, but after rewatching and revisiting ditto. I saw something and thought about something I didn't catch before...

During Hanni's ""iphone"" scene, she writes a letter TO Heeso saying ""please answer"", like telling her to please get back to her or essentially talk to her back. 

And in Ditto, we see Heeso ""Filming"" the girls, like MAYBE it's some sort of memory. 

I know that Ditto was a metaphor for a paracosial KPop/idol relationship, but hear me out, let's jump in the rabbit hole... 

During Danielle's part in OMG, she tells the girls, ""Don't You Remember who we are?"" And then they show clips of NewJeans. 

We also see, Parts of Ditto during the OMG VIDEO where they were dancing in their uniforms..

So here's the connection:

Heeso had a group of friends, that later on became KPop Idols. 
So the loneliness she was feeling, the feeling of her being left behind, 
IS her group of friends becoming famous. 

Again, I know that it is about the KPop/Idol relationship, 
Which validates my point.

In the story, Heeso was a PART of their group of friends, but sadly, only the main 5 became KPop Idols, while Heeso stayed back and chose to be ""normal"" and fall in love , and just grow old in a normal social life.

That's why when Heeso was watching the tapes back, she remembers the times that she had with the main girls.

Now that the girls are famous, the metaphor for OMG , is

FAME tends to make one lose TOUCH of who they REALLY are.
They lose a sense of self. 
A sense of reality.
FAME is an excellent servant, but a terrible master.

So losing who you are in the process of becoming famous can really be hard on ones mental health. 

That's why each girl has their own problems.

To tie it all together, 
Heeso has a YouTube channel right?
Clearly she's ""part"" of the story.

(I get it, she's a metaphor for Idol/KPop fan relationship)

But on a DEEPER level, 

Heeso is a girl, who ones had friends in school, then those friends later on became NewJeans. That's why she felt betrayed, even lonely, breaking the camera, throwing away the memories they had.

It's ok to be a normal person, fame isn't for everyone.
So NewJeans, especially Hanni, in the beginning is saying 

""Heeso please answer"" 

And all the callbacks for the ditto video, like when they were dancing, 
Solidifies the fact that They WERE in school with Heeso.

She probably WAS imagining them, but I see it as HER looking back at memories. 
Cameras or Video recorders are mainly used for LOOKING BACK at your memories. You take pictures so it can be forever engrained in your mind.

So to sum it all up, 

DITTO AND OMG Is about KPop/fan parasocial relationship, 
But the MYSTERIOUS deeper connection, on a STORY level is that:

Heeso was a part of their group, but for some sad turn of events, maybe her injury or something happened where she couldn't audition with NewJeans,
She was left behind in school which got her feeling alone, but then she met a boy and lived a normal life.

426,NewJeans,NewJeans is the only girl group I like since the inception of K-pop!,"I really have not been such a big fan of a K-pop girl group before until NewJeans came in. Everything about them is immediately so different.

1. Image/Concept ‚Äî in a time when everyone‚Äôs trying to do a girl crush concept, NJ‚Äôs y2k style is really a breath of fresh air. While idk how this concept will pan out as they mature, right now it encapsulates their youth perfectly. And most importantly they don‚Äôt have to be in clothes too mature or inappropriate for their age. 

Honestly, while girl crush seems so admirable because of a ‚Äústrong woman‚Äù image, it‚Äôs not really relatable. If I were to take BP as an example of a girl group (since it‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm most into before NJ and out of all other GG in the scene), while I like and will bop to their top hits, their lyrics never sit right with me because it always sounds like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a better woman than you‚Äù and that doesn‚Äôt sound very women-power to me :-/ I feel like the girl crush concept has also led to very toxic fandoms with the fans pitting the members against one another. üôÑ

And for other GG, if they aren‚Äôt doing the girl crush concept then it‚Äôs always too cutesy for me. 

So NewJeans‚Äô concept really drew me in because it‚Äôs so unique and and pure. It‚Äôs cool yet not intimidating. 

2. Music ‚Äî I know they only have 6 songs but all of them are such earworms! It took me awhile to get into OMG but now it‚Äôs completely stuck in my head. My brain will randomly go ‚Äúoh my oh my god‚Ä¶‚Äù out of nowhere and it‚Äôs not even annoying. 

I‚Äôm no professional in music so I can‚Äôt perfectly describe why their songs work for me‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôm just sick of the same old beats and drops in kpop. The only other GG songs that have made me feel like ‚Äúoh this is something different‚Äù is ASAP by STAYC and Dolphin by OMG. 

3. Visuals ‚Äî Again, the only GG that had me WOW-ed at first sight. Might be mean of me to say this but for other GGs, maybe only 1 or 2 will stand out and the rest looks pretty common or similar in a‚Ä¶ manufactured way? However, all the NJs members really stood out to me. I did have trouble differentiating them at the start (except for Danielle) in their debut photos because they looked similar with the big rounded eyes and full lips but it‚Äôs not like they have common faces‚Ä¶ each of them just has really unique features and aura that I‚Äôve not felt from a GG before! 

Lastly, might be too early to say this too but the girls just seem really genuine and sweet ‚Äî none of the sassy savage princessy vibes. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve trained for really long together (maybe 2-3 years according to wiki?) but it seems like they bonded really well. 

Really can‚Äôt wait for more song releases this year. They‚Äôre gonna go so far! And also hoping the fandom won‚Äôt turn toxic. ü§ûüèª

490,NewJeans,searching for NewJeans concept content,"hi all, 

I‚Äôve been watching newjeans‚Äô activities since debut as a casual fan. I‚Äôm currently in the process of writing an essay at university, my topic is how newjeans‚Äô aesthetic &amp; artist image reflects our cultural obsession with the aesthetics of the past (namely late 1990s and early 2000s web culture)

I have been doing my best to compile my own examples of their concept in promotional media, teasers, physical albums and more. but I was wondering if there was an existing collection for me to access of examples of this? - or perhaps if you have a personal favourite time we see their aesthetic coming to light, please link me to it in the comments below. 

I‚Äôm a little overwhelmed at their amount of content- I only truly stan two groups in kpop and I‚Äôm out of practice for going through a backlog of work!

as mentioned I am writing specifically about what forms their concept, and how Min Heejin has crafted everything together to create the newjeans image. a good example of what sort of content I‚Äôd like to be linked to is [this!](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CgUVU54JXGx/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY=)

499,NewJeans,The Legend Of 'Dance Practice' Haerin...,"through out history, there Are stories of legends, mythical creatures like BigFoot, the loch Ness monster, the yeti, and Kobe Bryant in the 4th quarter being talked about since the dawn of time.
Are these just stories? Shadows of our subconscious? Or are these real?

But all the time, people say they've spotted or caught this creature on camera.

Growing up, I was always a fan of YouTube. I remember Cat videos ALWAYS blowing up on the internet, getting millions of views, because, cats are cute? Cats are adorable? Cats are viral? All of the above.

So what does Kobe Bryant, and Cats on YouTube have to do with each other?
Let me introduce you, to Kang Haerin. 
Specifically, Dance Practice Haerin. 

As we all know, before every performance, the artists have to practice, and this is where blood sweat and tears, turn into clapping and shouting from thousands of fans.
The days you practice will impact the nights you perform.

And EVERY time there's a dance practice, Haerin shows up. Period. 
She MURDERS every. Single. Time.

A couple weeks ago, they released a Dance Practice for the MMA award show, and boy, did we see a star being born, dance practice Haerin was on full display. Literally every comment was praising how good and crisp she was and rightfully so. 

The legend goes: every time they have a dance practice, Haerin will have an aura, a peace about her that just takes over her body and releases a dancing machine.

Haters will say, ""The MMA dance practice was a Fluke, a one off thing, she won't be able to replicate that."" 

Scene enter: Ditto Practice, OMG practice, both of her just absolutely DESTROYING the choreo. The ""Tell Me"" practice where she gets a Dance break, obliterates it. 

So, the legend grows, every day.

I think what makes her such a great dancer, is also her best attribute, her personality. She's shy, introverted, doesn't talk much, but boy when it's time to dance. She's a machine. Her moves are on point. She hits every beat, and she's just a natural.

Her being shy just makes it that much more surprising and it's almost jarring to see someone so shy just EXPLODE with that much power. 

Remember the time Michael Jordan jumped off the freethrow line?
Yea that's Haerin on every dance practice. immaculate. 

So the next time you see a dance practice uploaded by NewJeans, bet your bottom dollar,

501,NewJeans,NJ live vocals and kpop SOPs,"I've come across several posts that are centred on live vocals, lip synching and dancing (don't want to get into it). Recently started watching newjeans live performances, and I wasn't aware about prerecordings and backtracks etc. My discussion/post would like to focus on the members live vocals especially when they have to do their choreo. 

I might be grasping at straws, but do they have mic(s) on for some members and for others not? I don't have a bias here, but I can't help but notice I typically can hear the short girl (Hanni, I think) sing live a lot, sometimes Minji, and sometimes Danielle. But most times, they choose not to sing over the track. I could be imagining it, but is this standard operating procedure in kpop? Like some sing live, others dont, others dampen their voices in the track. Plus hanni (googled her name, sorry new at this), has lines over choreo with lots of (jumping) movement, while the rest don't necessarily have this. 

Think of for instance hypeboy, the high ah ah part for hanni vs danielle (hanni has got to move, while danielle stays in place). In cookie as well, she seems to have lines in the intense part of the choreo.

The tall one, Hyein, skip-hop-jumping parts in live performances, you can barely here any inconsistency in her singing, which seems not quite accurate (which implies to me, she could have an off mic, or just not vocalizing enough).

And sometimes they all just sound like the studio version. 


So my question is what's up with live performances? Oh and in some, they sound good but kind of altered (like in the its live performance) 


Lastly, I'd like to see how Haerin (the one who is likened to a cat alot), and Minji sound like in tracks where they are like the main singers or something. So any ador staff lurking here, let's see. 

As I type this, I'm learning that hyein is the youngest (thought it was minji). After reading that she's been in the industry for quite a while, I think her voice and charisma shows this. She seems to be aware on how to present as cute, and professional when the camera is on her (when she has her singing lines). But when the camera is not on her, I notice a lot of hiccups in her dancing (which is understandable). Is it typical to have younger teens in kpop? I would source this info out on other subs, but I came across an unpalatable nsfw sub with kpop artists and chose the safety of this sub.

520,NewJeans,Asking for NewJeans Variety Shows/Content thread,"New fan here. I'm asking if there is a comprehensive guide or directory of NewJeans guesting in every show or digital content.

If I'm not mistaken, most of their videos are on their [official YouTube Channel](https://m.youtube.com/@NewJeans_official) and others are on [Hybe Channel](https://m.youtube.com/@HYBELABELS).

Recently, I discovered their TV guesting on [Yoo Quiz on the Block](https://youtu.be/l4udcYOFCOU), thanks for a redditor sharing the link. I'm English-speaking Asian and haven't tried to study Korean language so I heavily rely on English translated subtitles.

It took me 5 months to decide whether to stan NewJeans or not. [Their MBTI content](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8L51gF1Wb74) seal the deal for me. I'm amazed by their chemistry instantly, and especially the *radiating aura* of Hanni.

Also, I constantly encountered NewJeans song features from Variety Shows(e.g. Running Man, Amazing Saturday, How Do You Play) so I'm only familiar with *Attention* &amp; *Hype Boy* at that time. Now, *Hype Boy* is my fave song from them.

Honesty, I haven't watched *Omg* and *Ditto* yet (please spare me for this). I decided to binge watch their past variety content FIRST to see their growth and the timeframe I might missed before I jumped to their recent thread. Currently, I'm watching *NewJeans Code in Busan*.

521,NewJeans,Some critiques about OMG and the importance of pacing.,"***Sorry for the boring title name, I didn't want to make it too exaggerated. I also wrote a lot in this post, if you have low attention span, I apologize.***

Firstly I'd like to say that this is supposed to be constructive critique, I'm not here to bad mouth NewJeans or anything. I truly love all of their songs, and from a music producer lens, I love how they grab influences from genres or sounds that are less heard in Korea let alone KPOP. (All I can think of when listening to Hypeboy is Kaytranada). I do have some issues with OMG (MV+song) but overall in the grand scheme of things, NewJeans truly have been consistently innovative and strong in their vision. This post is all about love and the reason why I wrote this is because I want them to be the best they can be and by formulating the things that I believe they can improve on, I feel is a big defense against nonconstructive criticism from randos on the internet because (hopefully) through this post, people can then find their own words to fully articulate themselves and their opinions better.

Also I'm aware that I'm mostly speaking to a brick wall since this is Reddit and I'm not in front of the producers of NewJeans discussing with them or anything although if there's an off-chance that an ADOR/HYBE employee just happens to stumble upon this post, then please hear me out.

*(Btw I'm not going to discuss about whether or not there's a good/bad message in the story itself. Imma just let ADOR cook since that's not what my critique is focusing on).*  


So briefly, what did they do well with OMG?   


Well its a good song. I love the chord progression, the synths, the drums, it sounds modern, the song is well written with a really good topline melody (big props to the songwriters for this song and their other songs that came before). There are a couple of things that I have problems with but I'll mention that later on in the post.

The MV and its cinematography is undeniably more or less well directed and I guess this new film/camera director (which I'm not familiar with) has kdrama chops, we saw that with Ditto as well. It honestly feels very big budget mostly because of the acting. For some reason I was thinking that they had to take acting lessons for these MVs lol. 

Having said all that, OMG has some major pacing issues which I cannot gloss over.   


I think an amazing thing that ADOR did with their recent story-based MVs (Attention/Hypeboy) is that I could pretty much understand and conceptualize what the world they inhibit is about, what the characters in the MV are, the motivations and emotions that they harbor. Essentially there was a great sense of world building which made it compelling thanks to the great shots and the directing. I.E with Hypeboy I could immediately understand what was going on with the story, there was always a thread that you were able to follow even though it's all compact and compressed into a 3min+ video and I say this for all the member versions. Close-shots of vital facial expressions, angles that forces you to hone in on certain characters/objects, all of these little directing tricks brought clarity and helped amplify key parts of the story. Not to mention the animations which weaved in and out which acted as a transition for the chorus, bonus points for that flex. 

Small things like these truly made Hypeboy what it was.

&amp;#x200B;

For OMG I don't think I can say the same thing.   
There's a sense of erratic-ness that emanates from the whole video that I did not expect going in and I honestly had very high expectations. The beginning part of the video is really interesting and compelling and they don't do a ton of expos√© dumping which naturally makes you expect things to be clarified throughout the rest of the MV.   
But it turns out whether or not they accomplished in telling that rest of the story (which I had trouble following) it's still too convoluted and confusing to actually properly digest in one go let alone twice. Paired that with a song structure which is a little unusual, having a verse which acts as a ""pre-chorus"" into the chorus but not having a clear indication that that is the pre-chorus (verse 1B), it makes it all a bit too much to handle and it's hard to keep up with the structure. 

*(I understand that in especially western songwriting, you don't actually differentiate that much nor do you usually have a pre-chorus that leads into the actual chorus but I think they needed that for OMG. In Hypeboy they made the outline explicitly clear with Hyein followed by Minji and you get a sense of* ***""it's going to drop at this moment!""****).*

There's also a sense of things being constant with no change in the song because of how long the first chorus feels. Correct me if I'm wrong but it seems like there's 8+8+8 bars for the first chorus which is odd to me. A initial chorus followed by a post-A and a post-B when most would just opt for only one post-chorus, it feels **very long**. Then you also have the verse 2 which feels **short** and again there's the same issue of the faint outline before it transitions to the chorus. I don't feel like the **""he's the one that's living in my system baby!""** is doing a good enough job at easing the listener into the chorus to be very honest. 

Circling back to the MV as well, when the 2nd chorus hits, the visual impact is not provided by the MV and again it feels like I'm wallowing in ambiguity of how to feel as I'm at this point a little lost in the structure and arrangement. I could also feel that the director might've not been that experienced in providing good shots of choreography as the shots that were shown didn't show a lot of the interesting parts of the dance nor did they linger long enough for it to make an impact (every Haerin shot getting cut in odd places I.e. Why?).   
But thankfully I think they did a good job with the bridge into the final chorus both sonically (I appreciate the buildup from the bridge into the final chorus) and visually because of how they showcased the last choreo part and the throwback to the sets from Ditto, which gave off a good sense of ""resolution"" in the end.  


Anyways, why am I even giving this long list of feedback? 

Well as mentioned before the pacing is very off this time around and it's so noticeable and apparent that my gut feeling is telling me that that many first time listeners and even long time listeners of NewJeans will be thrown off and not in a good way. I do think they did a good job of having really strong creative elements, so for the MV, incredible cinematography which is drama level, the song has strong musical elements with super smooth synth chords and I love the chorus vocals that Hanni + Danielle sings (whoever wrote that top-line, good job). 

Unfortunately it is undeniable that the MV is convoluted and with how the song interacts with the MV. The disconnect exists which you can't ignore and the structure + parts of the arrangement sometimes feels like a speed-bump which kinda hampers the potential of the song. Not to mention the possible listeners that will write this off inevitably because of having to repeat watch an MV to grasp the story. With Hypeboy I did not have this problem and I could gladly watch it once and walk away with a compelling story etched in my mind. Also as I'm writing this I'm now aware that a couple of performance videos are out for OMG and I can't help but think that if they took more shots from those sets it'd look better because of how they shot the choreo in those videos.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, OMG is **good**. The vocal melodies they provided to these girls are really well written. The cinematography is really nice looking. So I implore ADOR, Min Heejin, HYBE, or whomever, to be a little more careful to not clutter the amazing ideas they already have. The MV with the odd shots, exposition that doesn't really clarify the story and then the song with an odd-ball structure that makes first time listeners ""lost in the sauce"". 

First impressions are truly everything and that's the only reason I'm here today and listening to NewJeans, because of the impact their songs and MVs had not just on me but really the whole of South Korea. There's goodwill out there for NewJeans and people want the best for them. Now this one speed-bump is not enough to make them falter obviously but why risk it? 

All in all, I wish the best for them because honestly they're really one of the few interesting girl groups out there at the moment. And the vocals, man. It's been a while since I've heard a GG sing melodies like these. (Those Ditto vocals resides in my hall of fame.)

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR**

I feel like the MV and the song is a little convoluted and its a bit hard to follow the first couple of times. There are definitely things they can avoid since their initial creative ideas for both the song and MV is already very strong. Hopefully they're able to remedy this next time since this might give off a not so good impression since they've had such hot streak of amazing roll-outs.",0.67,"Some critiques about OMG and the importance of pacing. ***Sorry for the boring title name, I didn't want to make it too exaggerated. I also wrote a lot in this post, if you have low attention span, I apologize.***

Firstly I'd like to say that this is supposed to be constructive critique, I'm not here to bad mouth NewJeans or anything. I truly love all of their songs, and from a music producer lens, I love how they grab influences from genres or sounds that are less heard in Korea let alone KPOP. (All I can think of when listening to Hypeboy is Kaytranada). I do have some issues with OMG (MV+song) but overall in the grand scheme of things, NewJeans truly have been consistently innovative and strong in their vision. This post is all about love and the reason why I wrote this is because I want them to be the best they can be and by formulating the things that I believe they can improve on, I feel is a big defense against nonconstructive criticism from randos on the internet because (hopefully) through this post, people can then find their own words to fully articulate themselves and their opinions better.

Also I'm aware that I'm mostly speaking to a brick wall since this is Reddit and I'm not in front of the producers of NewJeans discussing with them or anything although if there's an off-chance that an ADOR/HYBE employee just happens to stumble upon this post, then please hear me out.

*(Btw I'm not going to discuss about whether or not there's a good/bad message in the story itself. Imma just let ADOR cook since that's not what my critique is focusing on).*  


So briefly, what did they do well with OMG?   


Well its a good song. I love the chord progression, the synths, the drums, it sounds modern, the song is well written with a really good topline melody (big props to the songwriters for this song and their other songs that came before). There are a couple of things that I have problems with but I'll mention that later on in the post.

The MV and its cinematography is undeniably more or less well directed and I guess this new film/camera director (which I'm not familiar with) has kdrama chops, we saw that with Ditto as well. It honestly feels very big budget mostly because of the acting. For some reason I was thinking that they had to take acting lessons for these MVs lol. 

Having said all that, OMG has some major pacing issues which I cannot gloss over.   


I think an amazing thing that ADOR did with their recent story-based MVs (Attention/Hypeboy) is that I could pretty much understand and conceptualize what the world they inhibit is about, what the characters in the MV are, the motivations and emotions that they harbor. Essentially there was a great sense of world building which made it compelling thanks to the great shots and the directing. I.E with Hypeboy I could immediately understand what was going on with the story, there was always a thread that you were able to follow even though it's all compact and compressed into a 3min+ video and I say this for all the member versions. Close-shots of vital facial expressions, angles that forces you to hone in on certain characters/objects, all of these little directing tricks brought clarity and helped amplify key parts of the story. Not to mention the animations which weaved in and out which acted as a transition for the chorus, bonus points for that flex. 

Small things like these truly made Hypeboy what it was.

&amp;#x200B;

For OMG I don't think I can say the same thing.   
There's a sense of erratic-ness that emanates from the whole video that I did not expect going in and I honestly had very high expectations. The beginning part of the video is really interesting and compelling and they don't do a ton of expos√© dumping which naturally makes you expect things to be clarified throughout the rest of the MV.   
But it turns out whether or not they accomplished in telling that rest of the story (which I had trouble following) it's still too convoluted and confusing to actually properly digest in one go let alone twice. Paired that with a song structure which is a little unusual, having a verse which acts as a ""pre-chorus"" into the chorus but not having a clear indication that that is the pre-chorus (verse 1B), it makes it all a bit too much to handle and it's hard to keep up with the structure. 

*(I understand that in especially western songwriting, you don't actually differentiate that much nor do you usually have a pre-chorus that leads into the actual chorus but I think they needed that for OMG. In Hypeboy they made the outline explicitly clear with Hyein followed by Minji and you get a sense of* ***""it's going to drop at this moment!""****).*

There's also a sense of things being constant with no change in the song because of how long the first chorus feels. Correct me if I'm wrong but it seems like there's 8+8+8 bars for the first chorus which is odd to me. A initial chorus followed by a post-A and a post-B when most would just opt for only one post-chorus, it feels **very long**. Then you also have the verse 2 which feels **short** and again there's the same issue of the faint outline before it transitions to the chorus. I don't feel like the **""he's the one that's living in my system baby!""** is doing a good enough job at easing the listener into the chorus to be very honest. 

Circling back to the MV as well, when the 2nd chorus hits, the visual impact is not provided by the MV and again it feels like I'm wallowing in ambiguity of how to feel as I'm at this point a little lost in the structure and arrangement. I could also feel that the director might've not been that experienced in providing good shots of choreography as the shots that were shown didn't show a lot of the interesting parts of the dance nor did they linger long enough for it to make an impact (every Haerin shot getting cut in odd places I.e.

526,NewJeans,"My Theory on the MV for ""OMG""","Hello :) I‚Äôve spent a few days watching this video nonstop, trying to figure out the hidden meaning behind it, and about 2 minutes before I started typing this out, the music video just clicked for me. However, this took me hours to fully understand, and it went through multiple changes. So with that being said, here‚Äôs my theory on the music video for ‚ÄúOMG.‚Äù

**!!!Disclaimer!!!** This is just my personal opinion, and to be honest, it is probably wrong, but I still stand by it! Also, if you‚Äôd like to read my theory on Ditto, you can find it here-[https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/10487rt/was\_heeso\_newjeanss\_friend\_or\_not/j33u3l8/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewJeans/comments/10487rt/was_heeso_newjeanss_friend_or_not/j33u3l8/?context=3)  (the link tool isn't working on my phone, sad sad sad)

So, to get a grasp on the entire premise of the music video, you have to listen to one of the first things that Hanni says:

*‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm starting to get confused between what others say about me and the real me.‚Äù*

While Ditto was an INCREDIBLE story of a fan‚Äôs obsession with idols, OMG flips the script and is about NewJeans beginning to lose their true selves. The line between who they are and who the media and fans think they are is getting thinner and thinner, and they are losing who they are as normal girls along the way. They aren‚Äôt the perfect idols that fans want them to be.

I‚Äôm going to go through each member‚Äôs reason behind why they were at the psychiatric hospital and what it represents.

**Hanni -** this one is pretty straightforward because it sets the tone of the whole video; she believes she is an iPhone. But what she says is very interesting. ‚ÄúI exist for you.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter who I am anymore.‚Äù She is an idol, she believes her only goal is to bring us entertainment by ‚Äúspeaking and singing for us.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt matter to her anymore who she really is, as long as we are happy. But she is overwhelmed by trying to be our form of entertainment, shown when she is trying to rummage through the hundreds of emails or gets tired after running on the vinyl. iPhones provide endless amounts of entertainment, but it is apparent that she can't provide that; even she has her limits.

**Minji -** she believes she is actually a doctor that is taking care of the rest of the group. This represents her role as the leader of NewJeans. As a leader in anything, you have a lot of responsibility. She is shown as a doctor behind each girls‚Äô hallucinations, which represents her trying to help them with their problems as the group‚Äôs leader. She's actively playing the role of leader and takes them to the hospital because she realizes that her members all are starting to lose who they were pre-debut. But, the last person she reaches out to help turns out to be herself. Spending a lot of time helping the other members has left Minji little time for self-reflecting and healing. As the leader, who is there to help her with her problems? She is the first one in the group to realize that they need to talk about their issues.

**Hyein -** this one was the toughest to decipher, but I think I figured it out. This is going to be a long one because A LOT happens. Hyein opens a book titled ‚ÄúMy Love Story.‚Äù In the book, there are seven titles of movies or stories:

\-La Boum

\-Cinderella

\-Subway

\-A Little Match Girl

\-Snow White

\-Sleeping Beauty

\-Revenant

Although Subway could just be a literal subway because the only films I found are titled that just don‚Äôt make sense in regards to the MV. Danielle is acting as Hyein‚Äôs love interest and when she puts the headphones on Hyein, it is based on a scene from La Boum, a French teen romance film. Then, Hyein‚Äôs apple watch strikes midnight and she leaves Danielle, who finds her glass slipper like Cinderella. She gets into the subway but then she is in a dark room, lighting a match like the girl from the fairy tale A Little Match Girl, which is a somber story about a dying girl that sees her hopes and dreams each time she lights a match. Then Haerin appears holding a poison apple like in Snow White, which Hyein eats and becomes paralyzed. She is waiting for true love‚Äôs kiss to wake her up. Danielle, like Prince Phillip in Sleeping Beauty, is now seen riding her motorcycle to help Hyein, but she is immediately dead on the ground, and a bear, like in Revenant, is towering over a still-paralyzed Hyein.

So what does it all mean? Well, I believe when it is black and white, it is her time before she becomes an idol. Hyein is holding a bunny cake when Danielle puts headphones on her, which represents her accepting her role as a member of NewJeans. Hyein leaves her normal teenage life, represented by Danielle, to travel to Hybe to become an idol. As soon as she lights the match to see her dreams and goals, Haerin offers her a poison apple, or idol life, which is tempting but dangerous. Why? Because she‚Äôs fourteen, barely a teenager. As soon as Hyein lights the match, it goes from black and white to color. This is when Hyein becomes an idol and is living what the world believes is a fairy tale. Danielle, her normal life, comes racing to try and overcome the fame, now showing its true colors by being seen as a bear, but Danielle doesn‚Äôt succeed. This leaves her scared and vulnerable. In a video on Ban Heesoo's channel, it is mentioned that she has ""princess syndrome."" But she isn‚Äôt living the fairy tale people think she is, she‚Äôs just a young teenager in the big world of K-pop.

**Haerin -** She sees herself as a cat. In reality, her feline-like features have given her quite some attention, to the point that it‚Äôs her only identity. If anyone doesn‚Äôt know this, the plastic wrapper that she is eating is a Korean treat for cats. However, she is seen drawing pictures through the MV. I believe it represents her creativity and talent, that she is more than her physical features. Also, when she is listening to the other girls talk about who or what they think they are, Haerin is drawing them on her notepad. This could possibly represent her being a true introvert. She isn't like extrovert Minji, who is a doctor playing the role of actively trying to help the other girls with their problems. She instead decides to put them in writing, possibly representing that she still is there for them, but in her own way.

**Danielle -** She is shown laughing at a tv screen with nothing on it. This represents her being seen as the always happy and smiling member of the group, no matter how she‚Äôs actually feeling. She feels like she is almost forced to show that she is a ray of sunshine at all times. Later, she realizes they are shooting a music video. Some people think that is why she is at the psychiatric hospital, but I believe that Danielle is actually right. She is the first one that wants to go back to when they debuted. Before they garnered all this fame and attention. Before they started losing who they really are. She then reminds the girls that they are NewJeans, and the video flashes back to Attention. She wishes to go back to when they started, back to when they knew who they were.

**Heesoo -** if you look closely during the girls‚Äô dance breaks when they are in their hospital gowns, there is a sixth patient sitting in a chair in the background. I believe this is Ban Heesoo or bunnies. The girls are dancing in their gowns, and at times they aren‚Äôt smiling, sometimes even frowning, and the lighting in the room is very dim. But, then the scene changes and they are in new clothes in the hospital with brighter lighting, and it changes once more and they are at a party. In both these scenes, they are smiling and happy. I believe this is what Heesoo, or bunnies, believe that NewJeans are feeling at all times, nothing but joy. However, the reality is that they are just like her, they have mental anguish just like she does. When the girls are dancing at the party, none of the people in the background even notice they are there. This is a big indicator that they aren‚Äôt even there and that this is all in Heesoo‚Äôs imagination.

**The ending -**  when it flashes back to Attention, they sing ‚ÄúGot me looking for attention‚Äù but Minji stops it before it continues. I truly believe the girls have come to realize that they need to fix their problems and go back to the beginning when they knew who they were, before the attention. She then leads the girls out of the room, now much better off than when the video started.

**The male patient -** The male patient is on the outside looking in, and sees the girls at the round table as different people in different fields and lifestyles. I believe this shows that everyone is dealing with something in life, and we all need to work on our mental health, no matter how different the problems we are dealing with are.

**The doctor -** I had a theory about him, but /u/Baracudasi told me that he is played by Korean cartoonist Lee Byung Gun. This completely changed his role for me. I now believe that at the beginning, he doesn‚Äôt understand why they are dealing with these problems, they‚Äôre wealthy and famous. But at the end, he picks up the notepad with Haerin‚Äôs drawings depicting all of the different things the girls think they are. They then come to life in his head, because he has a newfound understanding and appreciation that they are more than what the world portrays them as.

**Post-credits scene -** Someone is typing a post stating that they are uncomfortable with the themes in their music videos and wish they would just look pretty and dance. This is obviously a hater of NewJeans and the deeper message in their music videos. People don‚Äôt like seeing things that make them feel uncomfortable, because it is painful to analyze their own lives. In many cultures, mental health isn‚Äôt seen as a serious issue, so some people just want a shallow message, not a deep, profound one. Minji, dressed as a doctor, comes in and tells the unknown person that their ‚Äútime‚Äôs up.‚Äù They are also a patient and it shows that even their haters are dealing with their own problems and they need just as much help as everyone else.

This music video‚Äôs message is way too deep for anyone to get the full picture, and it is honestly up to the viewer to come to their own conclusions. I‚Äôm pretty sure I missed a ton of things and was wrong on many others, but from my perspective, this is an absolutely amazing representation that the girls are just like us, they are human too and they are much more than what the media and the idol system represent them as. It has a huge focus on mental health, which doesn‚Äôt have much representation in today‚Äôs world. It also shows how the idol system can have lasting repercussions on the idols themselves, and a conversation needs to be had about it.

So, to get a grasp on the entire premise of the music video, you have to listen to one of the first things that Hanni says:

*‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm starting to get confused between what others say about me and the real me.‚Äù*

While Ditto was an INCREDIBLE story of a fan‚Äôs obsession with idols, OMG flips the script and is about NewJeans beginning to lose their true selves. The line between who they are and who the media and fans think they are is getting thinner and thinner, and they are losing who they are as normal girls along the way. They aren‚Äôt the perfect idols that fans want them to be.

I‚Äôm going to go through each member‚Äôs reason behind why they were at the psychiatric hospital and what it represents.

**Hanni -** this one is pretty straightforward because it sets the tone of the whole video; she believes she is an iPhone. But what she says is very interesting. ‚ÄúI exist for you.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter who I am anymore.‚Äù She is an idol, she believes her only goal is to bring us entertainment by ‚Äúspeaking and singing for us.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt matter to her anymore who she really is, as long as we are happy. But she is overwhelmed by trying to be our form of entertainment, shown when she is trying to rummage through the hundreds of emails or gets tired after running on the vinyl. iPhones provide endless amounts of entertainment, but it is apparent that she can't provide that; even she has her limits.

**Minji -** she believes she is actually a doctor that is taking care of the rest of the group. This represents her role as the leader of NewJeans. As a leader in anything, you have a lot of responsibility. She is shown as a doctor behind each girls‚Äô hallucinations, which represents her trying to help them with their problems as the group‚Äôs leader. She's actively playing the role of leader and takes them to the hospital because she realizes that her members all are starting to lose who they were pre-debut. But, the last person she reaches out to help turns out to be herself. Spending a lot of time helping the other members has left Minji little time for self-reflecting and healing. As the leader, who is there to help her with her problems? She is the first one in the group to realize that they need to talk about their issues.

**Hyein -** this one was the toughest to decipher, but I think I figured it out. This is going to be a long one because A LOT happens. Hyein opens a book titled ‚ÄúMy Love Story.‚Äù In the book, there are seven titles of movies or stories:

\-La Boum

\-Cinderella

\-Subway

\-A Little Match Girl

\-Snow White

\-Sleeping Beauty

\-Revenant

Although Subway could just be a literal subway because the only films I found are titled that just don‚Äôt make sense in regards to the MV. Danielle is acting as Hyein‚Äôs love interest and when she puts the headphones on Hyein, it is based on a scene from La Boum, a French teen romance film. Then, Hyein‚Äôs apple watch strikes midnight and she leaves Danielle, who finds her glass slipper like Cinderella. She gets into the subway but then she is in a dark room, lighting a match like the girl from the fairy tale A Little Match Girl, which is a somber story about a dying girl that sees her hopes and dreams each time she lights a match. Then Haerin appears holding a poison apple like in Snow White, which Hyein eats and becomes paralyzed. She is waiting for true love‚Äôs kiss to wake her up. Danielle, like Prince Phillip in Sleeping Beauty, is now seen riding her motorcycle to help Hyein, but she is immediately dead on the ground, and a bear, like in Revenant, is towering over a still-paralyzed Hyein.

So what does it all mean? Well, I believe when it is black and white, it is her time before she becomes an idol. Hyein is holding a bunny cake when Danielle puts headphones on her, which represents her accepting her role as a member of NewJeans. Hyein leaves her normal teenage life, represented by Danielle, to travel to Hybe to become an idol. As soon as she lights the match to see her dreams and goals, Haerin offers her a poison apple, or idol life, which is tempting but dangerous. Why? Because she‚Äôs fourteen, barely a teenager. As soon as Hyein lights the match, it goes from black and white to color. This is when Hyein becomes an idol and is living what the world believes is a fairy tale. Danielle, her normal life, comes racing to try and overcome the fame, now showing its true colors by being seen as a bear, but Danielle doesn‚Äôt succeed. This leaves her scared and vulnerable. In a video on Ban Heesoo's channel, it is mentioned that she has ""princess syndrome."" But she isn‚Äôt living the fairy tale people think she is, she‚Äôs just a young teenager in the big world of K-pop.

**Haerin -** She sees herself as a cat. In reality, her feline-like features have given her quite some attention, to the point that it‚Äôs her only identity. If anyone doesn‚Äôt know this, the plastic wrapper that she is eating is a Korean treat for cats. However, she is seen drawing pictures through the MV. I believe it represents her creativity and talent, that she is more than her physical features. Also, when she is listening to the other girls talk about who or what they think they are, Haerin is drawing them on her notepad. This could possibly represent her being a true introvert. She isn't like extrovert Minji, who is a doctor playing the role of actively trying to help the other girls with their problems. She instead decides to put them in writing, possibly representing that she still is there for them, but in her own way.

**Danielle -** She is shown laughing at a tv screen with nothing on it. This represents her being seen as the always happy and smiling member of the group, no matter how she‚Äôs actually feeling. She feels like she is almost forced to show that she is a ray of sunshine at all times. Later, she realizes they are shooting a music video. Some people think that is why she is at the psychiatric hospital, but I believe that Danielle is actually right. She is the first one that wants to go back to when they debuted. Before they garnered all this fame and attention. Before they started losing who they really are. She then reminds the girls that they are NewJeans, and the video flashes back to Attention. She wishes to go back to when they started, back to when they knew who they were.

**Heesoo -** if you look closely during the girls‚Äô dance breaks when they are in their hospital gowns, there is a sixth patient sitting in a chair in the background. I believe this is Ban Heesoo or bunnies. The girls are dancing in their gowns, and at times they aren‚Äôt smiling, sometimes even frowning, and the lighting in the room is very dim. But, then the scene changes and they are in new clothes in the hospital with brighter lighting, and it changes once more and they are at a party. In both these scenes, they are smiling and happy. I believe this is what Heesoo, or bunnies, believe that NewJeans are feeling at all times, nothing but joy. However, the reality is that they are just like her, they have mental anguish just like she does. When the girls are dancing at the party, none of the people in the background even notice they are there. This is a big indicator that they aren‚Äôt even there and that this is all in Heesoo‚Äôs imagination.

**The ending -**  when it flashes back to Attention, they sing ‚ÄúGot me looking for attention‚Äù but Minji stops it before it continues. I truly believe the girls have come to realize that they need to fix their problems and go back to the beginning when they knew who they were, before the attention. She then leads the girls out of the room, now much better off than when the video started.

**The male patient -** The male patient is on the outside looking in, and sees the girls at the round table as different people in different fields and lifestyles. I believe this shows that everyone is dealing with something in life, and we all need to work on our mental health, no matter how different the problems we are dealing with are.

**The doctor -** I had a theory about him, but /u/Baracudasi told me that he is played by Korean cartoonist Lee Byung Gun. This completely changed his role for me. I now believe that at the beginning, he doesn‚Äôt understand why they are dealing with these problems, they‚Äôre wealthy and famous. But at the end, he picks up the notepad with Haerin‚Äôs drawings depicting all of the different things the girls think they are. They then come to life in his head, because he has a newfound understanding and appreciation that they are more than what the world portrays them as.

**Post-credits scene -** Someone is typing a post stating that they are uncomfortable with the themes in their music videos and wish they would just look pretty and dance. This is obviously a hater of NewJeans and the deeper message in their music videos. People don‚Äôt like seeing things that make them feel uncomfortable, because it is painful to analyze their own lives. In many cultures, mental health isn‚Äôt seen as a serious issue, so some people just want a shallow message, not a deep, profound one. Minji, dressed as a doctor, comes in and tells the unknown person that their ‚Äútime‚Äôs up.‚Äù They are also a patient and it shows that even their haters are dealing with their own problems and they need just as much help as everyone else.

This music video‚Äôs message is way too deep for anyone to get the full picture, and it is honestly up to the viewer to come to their own conclusions. I‚Äôm pretty sure I missed a ton of things and was wrong on many others, but from my perspective, this is an absolutely amazing representation that the girls are just like us, they are human too and they are much more than what the media and the idol system represent them as. It has a huge focus on mental health, which doesn‚Äôt have much representation in today‚Äôs world. It also shows how the idol system can have lasting repercussions on the idols themselves, and a conversation needs to be had about it.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. :) What is your theory on this music video?"
527,NewJeans,OMG (not sure how to title this),"Started listening to kpop (specifically NewJeans) quite recently because my teenage cousin always has kpop on. NewJeans kind of shocked me because they aren't what I always believed kpop to be, in a good way. Anyway, long story short, they are a cool group and I really like their music.

OMG took me a quite a few listens to really appreciate it. And the chorus had me thinking: are there any GALIMATIAS listeners here? I'm not promoting him or anything, but the OMG chorus beats/sound reminds me of Galimatias - Let Go (from min 2:30) and Galimatias &amp; Alina Baraz - Fantasy.

Does OMG chorus remind someone of anything similar?

528,NewJeans,My 2 Braincells have decided on my final OMg theory,"As most people have stated the Ditto to OMG storyline is a meta look at Parasocial Relationships with Idols. The fans love the idols and they become their everything and a reason for them to go through their every day. The Idols live to sing and dance and make people happy, they often do so so much that they lose themselves in the process. Below are my final takes on each New Jeans member in this story....

Minji is our Leader (Unofficially of course) so she bears the burden of protecting the girls, she knows they're sick and will do anything to get them better. She's so hyper focused on this task however she doesn't notice she's just like them and is at the same risk they are in this industry.

Hyein is about as classic [Princess Syndrome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_sickness) as one can get. Hyein is where i begin to believe that the team behind Newjeans has done a lot of research about these girls and how they are perceived. It has never been stated to us that Hyein is the visual but she's tall and striking and in online communities is in fact the member most treated as such. This was a perfect role for her to take on

Hanni was more on the nose as well as she had the opening monologue stating that they exist for us, to sing and dance. I however want to take this a step further because Hanni herself being the one casted from Youtube cover dances is probably the most visible example in this group of someone wanting to be an Idol with all her might. I think giving her this part plays into her background a lot.

Haerin is Maknae like so her child like tendencies are to be expected. Living in lala land, the drawings, she doesn't say anything in the video she simply just draws and is told what to do. The cat thing has two meanings imo, the first of which being a child's imagination and becoming that. The second obviously being her cat like visuals fans constantly attribute to her so in her mind she's a cat because we call her a cat.

Danielle at first appears to be the one most grounded until you take into account her vitamin moniker, always smiling and laughing at everything to create joy. She's seen watching a tv screen with nothing on it but static but still finding joy. Danielle is an idols idol she was pretty much born for every aspect of this business. It's not a surprise to me that she's the one hyper aware that they are newjeans.

That's my take and i love this song and video so much because it can simply be a lovesick anthem about a crush or anything we put our minds too and that's what makes good creative direction.

619,NewJeans,'OMG' by NewJeans - MV Theories,"Okay, so my thoughts on the music video so far -

This video is about the delusions we have about our selves, and how far those can be from reality. All five girls have a delusion they grapple with:

1. Hanni - Her's was explicitly outline, she believes she is Siri or an Iphone. Basically she believes she is a device meant to best service others.
2. Minji - She believes herself to be a doctor, trying to cure the other members and putting them all in an ambulance, but also herself. We she this when she walks up to 'herself,' squatting on the road, and puts herself in the ambulance taking all the girls to the hospital. Maybe she is taking on the burden of finding cures, or comfort for other.
3. Hyein - She is depicted as thinking of herself as a princess, or a character from fictional books. We see this as she is presented in the role of a modern day Cinderella, while Danielle plays her Prince Charming. We see Danielle wooing Hyein, and then then the clock, or in this case Apple watch, striking 12 and Hyein runs away in a subway 'carriage.' We also see her depicted as Snow White, who eats a poisoned apple and then wakes up not to a prince but a bear. Maybe this combines the Goldilocks story, where Goldilocks steals the bears bed. Hyein seems to have regret for this decision, as she looks at a teddy bear forlornly later.
4. Haerin - She is very aptly playing a cat. She seems to think of herself as one, as in one seen all the other four girls gaze at a cat, and she can later be seen eating what I think is cat food as the other members again watch on.
5. Danielle - We first see Danielle laugh and point at a TV playing static. This sets her up, for later in the video where she is revealed to have the delusion of thinking she is NewJeans or an idol. We see her insisting to the others they are a girl group shooting a music video, and then a medley of videos of NewJeans play. This all ends when Minji in the Attention video says 'All right, stop.' This is as if, Minji in her role as the doctor, as infiltrated Danielle's deluded memories and is asking her to stop for now.

There are lots of other fun things to interpret in the video, but I think it is essentially trying to send the message that in a digital age we are desperately trying to connect to others, but we do so through fake personas and identities, failing then to form real relationships.

Further down the line, she became so depressed that she killed herself when her only source of happiness had become new jeans themselves. She glitches as when heeso is thinking about her, she hesitates and mentally semi breaks down after remembering her tragic death.

629,NewJeans,"Theory about ""'OMG"" MV","So where do I start, OMG is a story about A girl, who's ""crazy"" for a boy. 
She keeps saying that ""they keep asking who is he"" , she replies with ""he's the one in my system"" like she can't get him out of her head. And this is very common with teens and young people, when you're in love, you kinda get obsessed with that person. BUT the music video shows different types of obsessions that each girl is going through, 

Keep in mind, the setting for the story is a 'Mental Hospital'

Let's break it down:

1. hanni-
She's addicted to her phone. Like any young girl, all they do is look at their phone, be on social media, listen to music, and it's bad especially for the young generation. They're always staring at their phones, they BECOME one with their phones. They're inseparable. 

2. Minji-
She keeps saying that she's not a patient, when we see in her story line that she was also picked up by the ambulance with the other girls. This denial is very common with people that are ""crazy"", they keep saying ""I'm not crazy"" 
And she has the symptoms of being heartbroken, and by her INSISTING that she's not a patient and she even thinks she's a Nurse there, shows that she is crazy lol 

3. Hyein-
Hyein has the very common symptoms of, FAIRTY TALE addiction. 
Most young people live their lives reading Fantasy or Fairy Tale books, they start thinking that their life is a fairy tale. Hence, you see her open her book with Cinderella or snow white on the cover. But this is not reality, most girls that think life is a fairy tale and prince charming is guna come save her, is quite delusional. The harsh reality is that life IS NOT a fairy tale but I can see why thinking that it is can be deemed crazy. A lot of young girls grow up on Disney etc. 

4. Haerin 
This one is simple. Have you heard of the Furry fandom? 
This girl LITERALLY thinks she's a cat. In the music video, you see the other members looking at her, and then she keeps turning into a cat one scene and drawing pictures of cats. THERE ARE A LOT of young people who identify as ""being an animal"" which CAN seem crazy...

5. Danielle
Danielles problem is simple. She THINKS the world is a TV show or she thinks that she's being filmed. This is a super meta conversation because TECHNICALLY she is being filmed. Lol but her characters ""Crazy"" comes from her thinking her life is just a Show and every one is always filming her. Which these are classic symptoms of being ""crazy"" 
There are people in the world who believe that they're being filmed even they're not or that they're life is a TV show ex. The Truman show with Jim Carrey

So these are the 5 metaphors for ""crazy"" or they're more like examples of ""crazy"" that young people go through nowadays.

In the end you can see a guy pick up the drawing, and you see the characters turn into different people, which is telling me that the very last guy we see is probably just hallucinating all the main characters.


But in the end, OMG SONG is about a young girl who is Crazy about a boy.

Of course theres some other dimensions to it, references to other Korean film and even the fandom in general, but the main thrust I believe is experiences as a girl while growing up.

NewJeans in the Ditto MV are symbolic representatives of childhood, carefree, innocent, with energy.  Heeseo, who is filming them, is part of that group, the song is pumping, then she notices a boy looking at her.  She looks away, she never noticed that boy before.  The music becomes tense, has something changed in her?

The music stops, the scene changes.  Shes idly drinking at the fountain, and the boy approaches.  The song begins, as if to signify something washing over her.

As both music videos progress, you see Heeseo begin pulling away from NewJeans, sometimes agitated.  Focusing herself more on the boy.  And watching NewJeans at a distance, as if they are fading into the background. The vanishing NewJeans and destroyed camera perhaps signifying a fear of change, or that shes destroying a part of herself.

At the end of both MV's she watches afar at a Fawn, the symbol of innocence, and in MV2, the fawn walks out of view, followed by a shot of Heeseo with the boy, symbolizing the end of her childhood and the start of her teens.

Years later she is watching her old videos, and gives a smile, and NewJeans walks in and is there with her again.

682,NewJeans,"""Ditto"" Theory(?)","I am sure a lot of you have been reading or read a couple of theories about the MV story already, but I want to know if I'm reaching with this little something that just popped in my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I read in a theory that there's a movie called ""Ditto"" about a girl from 1979 communicating with a girl from 2000. With this in mind, Min Hee-jin (ADOR's CEO) was born in 1979, and all of the members are born in the 2000's. With the discovery of this ""Ban Heesoo"" channel, labeling/titling unseen footage from the MV locations with the dates ""1998"", this would mean Min Hee-jin is 19 at the time, right? I don't know anything about Min Hee-jin, I don't even know if we even have enough information about her as an individual for me to confirm or deny this, but what if Hee-soo is also Min Hee-jin? A girl who started envisioning something (a group/NewJeans) at a young age, but no one else saw the same things she did, people didn't see eye to eye with her ideas. I don't know where it was I read this from, but I think she said that it was an honor to be given the opportunity to create something entirely from her ideals/point-of-view and that she was thankful to Bang Si-hyuk for the opportunity to be under HYBE, also someone who trusted her vision. I don't really know where I'm going with this, I just saw a video from NewJeans tik-tok that reminded me of Min Hee-jin's instagram account just being a second NewJeans account full of content/photos of them and thought that maybe Min Hee-jin just wanted to portray herself as a same age friend to the members because she loves them so much. (I know she didn't write ""Ditto"" MV's story line but she must have had some input)

&amp;#x200B;

Little something about Min Hee-jin: During NewJeans appearance on You Quiz on the Block, Yoo Jae-suk jokingly asked if the ""Jean"" derived from the Min Hee-""jin"", where Min Hee-jin strongly denied the connection between the group's name and herself. This shows that she doesn't intend/want to be ""connected"" with them in that way. Thus, what I came up with is irrelevant and a big reach from my part.

&amp;#x200B;

AT THIS POINT I THINK I JUST LOVE MIN HEE-JIN TOO MUCH... What do you guys think, is it a reach? (I do think this isn't supposed to be the main point of the story and the parasocial relationships are the most real/cohesive)",0.93,"""Ditto"" Theory(?)

744,NewJeans,NWJNS LORE (u/ppinkice and StatisticianRude6037)," I and my friend created a theory of Ditto by Newjeans, :p  Introduction: So this whole intro theory really splits into two parts, my friend is good at this stuff, and I'm not too good so it might be a bit messy, and confusing. This theory isn't 100% complete so some parts we **kinda** debunked ourselves but still included. Let us know if we were wrong about anything!!  The definition of Ditto from what we've researched basically a synonym as again. They say in the lyrics ""ÎßêÌï¥Ï§ò, say it back, oh, say it, ditto. Want you so, want you, so say it, ditto"" They keep mentioning how to keep saying Ditto over and over again ( New jeans is saying. ) But what exactly are they trying to have Heeseo ( the girl recording NWJNS ) do again..????  We feel like that new jeans are trying to say ""Keep saying you like us, don't leave us."" Or at least something like that.  ""The camera is trying to focus on the boy, as sometimes she's recording the guy. But NWJNS is haunting Heeseo and having her record them."" Also, when it says ""Want you so, want you so"" Many might think thats aimed towards the guy Heeseo likes, but really it's New jeans saying they want her to stay, not to move on.  Obviously, NWJNS are just in Heeseo's head. They don't exist, or do they? As Heeseo was recording, the end of clip B shows Heeseo watching the clips, if they didn't exist how did she get them on camera? What we've concluded from this is two theories were unable to pinpoint which matches more.  

    Conclusion 1:

Heeseo broke the camera, how was she able to play the recordings even after the camera was broken? What we think in conclusion is that she's still unaware even grown up. She's yet to get NWJNS out of their head, because, at one point in the MV part B, they show the TV playing only grain, nothing. Either she was watching  

    Conclusion 2:

Let's say she wasn't seeing things, and it truly was playing on TV. Heeseo might be the only one who can see NWJNS. The deer has many symbols, but it's mainly about love, and **spiritual awareness.**Those two meanings represent NWJNS's relation with Heeseo, but let's mainly talk about ""Spiritual awareness"". If NWJNS does exist, her camera DVDs are the only sort of proof she has they exist. ( This next short part was inspired by another users theory, u/huhNepi  ) NWJNS sort of live inside Heeseo's camera with those recordings, as once again others can't see her but Heeseo can. On to the point, what if NWJNS is talking to Heeseo spiritually? After Heeseo breaks the camera, they show a clip of a deer. What we thought was that NWJNS is trying to contact Heeseo. No matter how much Heeseo wants to move on, NWJNS won't leave Heeseo's mind. They have the power, but why won't they??? It's because NWJNS doesn't want her to.  

    Breaking of C2: 

 At the same time, when Heeseo woke up, I also feel like that might've been the part where she finally truly moved on, and the deer was at the same time representing she finally spiritually moved on.  Continuing C2: So what I believe is that they won't leave Heeseo's mind due to the fact that they are trying to make Heeoseo Spiritually aware of something, we aren't too sure about this next part but what we think is that even though Heeseo is trying to move on, deep inside she hasn't.  ------ Additional details we found within both parts A and B :  ‚Ä¢ We saw Heeseo painting Minji's nail, but instead she was the one who woke up with the painted nail. ‚Ä¢ The girls signed her cast but after waking up the signs were gone. ‚Ä¢ The deer appeared mainly after she broke the camera. ‚Ä¢ In part B, there was a short clip of Heeseo watching a TV that just played grain.  ***Glossary:***

C1 , C2 : Conclusion 1, Conclusion 2.

NWJNS: New Jeans

Additional Details: Just some extra key points that help support some of our theories sort of.

grain : Static (edited)",0.76,"NWJNS LORE (u/ppinkice and StatisticianRude6037)  I and my friend created a theory of Ditto by Newjeans, :p  Introduction: So this whole intro theory really splits into two parts, my friend is good at this stuff, and I'm not too good so it might be a bit messy, and confusing. This theory isn't 100% complete so some parts we **kinda** debunked ourselves but still included. Let us know if we were wrong about anything!!  The definition of Ditto from what we've researched basically a synonym as again. They say in the lyrics ""ÎßêÌï¥Ï§ò, say it back, oh, say it, ditto. Want you so, want you, so say it, ditto"" They keep mentioning how to keep saying Ditto over and over again ( New jeans is saying. ) But what exactly are they trying to have Heeseo ( the girl recording NWJNS ) do again..????  We feel like that new jeans are trying to say ""Keep saying you like us, don't leave us."" Or at least something like that.  ""The camera is trying to focus on the boy, as sometimes she's recording the guy. But NWJNS is haunting Heeseo and having her record them."" Also, when it says ""Want you so, want you so"" Many might think thats aimed towards the guy Heeseo likes, but really it's New jeans saying they want her to stay, not to move on.  Obviously, NWJNS are just in Heeseo's head. They don't exist, or do they? As Heeseo was recording, the end of clip B shows Heeseo watching the clips, if they didn't exist how did she get them on camera? What we've concluded from this is two theories were unable to pinpoint which matches more.  

    Conclusion 1:

Heeseo broke the camera, how was she able to play the recordings even after the camera was broken? What we think in conclusion is that she's still unaware even grown up.

( This next short part was inspired by another users theory, u/huhNepi  ) NWJNS sort of live inside Heeseo's camera with those recordings, as once again others can't see her but Heeseo can.

745,NewJeans,Ditto lore explained,"Hello everyone! This post is made for fun, because me and my friend were bored and at that time Ditto just got released. This is all a theory and please do correct me if there's a something incorrect about the lore. Thank you for reading! 


[COMPLIMENTARY THEORIES]

Ditto has a solid grasp of nostalgia and sentimentality, loneliness and coming of age and what it felt like to grow up in that strange transitory period between the late 90s and early 2000s. It's been so weirdly cool to see a Gen Z group embody the Millennial sensibility of this era and see bits and pieces of childhood thoughts through this creative direction. To have memories and evidence of a life worth living, a friend group that makes you feel loved and confident. To feel pretty, cool and carefree or to have the courage to just be yourself. It was so well done it was a little overwhelming but that's what makes it especially beautiful. 

This video represents perfectly the relationship between the audience and the idol. The audience is always there to watch the idol. using them to feel love, joy, connecting with them through their own similarities they feel they have with their idol. This can sometimes be one sided. the idol is often there in ""spirt"", but not always there in reality. Side A and Side B actually represent one whole scenario:
Side A is the beginning. We see that the girl is putting a video player to the TV, meanwhile on Side B we see that at the ending the girl is watching something on her TV. Meaning the whole Side A is the video she is watching. One can realize that even if not together physically, both the idol and audience can still accompany and love each other in a relationship that is understood mutually. Also, one can find that truth is too cold and replace that ""unphysical"" love and ""focus your lens""(the camera representing what you focus on) on a love thats more ""real"" like the girl does with guy she likes. However the ""idol""(NewJeans) will still be there no matter how long with open arms awaiting the next time they meet again(the deer). 

I love how this scenario give us a sad, nostalgic story. I think that this story is explicit to an interpretation: many of us take refuge in something like video games, books, drawings and in this case kpop, but at some point in our lives we leave it and take a path with other interests, and when we are older, perhaps, we return and although it is not the same, we appreciate it with nostalgia. There are some ideas that break my heart, because I think some people who were lonely when they were young had to say goodbye to a part of their innocence in order to fit in more with the people around them. It's horrible when you're young and you can't verbalize what you feel, and what's more, people around you judge you for who you are, especially if you're an introvert, a loner, or a big dreamer. 


[INNER THEORIES]

As we know in ""Ditto"" Side B, in the end we see ""Heesoo"" (the girl recording all the videos), putting a videotape of the recordings that she has done for her idols (NewJeans) and she's surprised seeing that even in the TV, they still appear which means they are there in reality aswell.
From this we made a theory how when Heesoo decides to break the camera, NewJeans get released, as when she does throw it, we hear screaming as if shes pushing someone off of the roof. Were NewJeans inside the camera? Was that the reason why when she recorded somewhere irl she was recording nothing but in the camera NewJeans were there dancing and having fun? After that scene we see Heesoos phone ringing from someone named ""Minji"", a member of the group.
From the vfx perspective, every recording of NewJeans is with a 90's effect, while irl, it doesn't. What i'm saying is that Minji, Haerin, Hyein, Danielle and Hanni do exist, not as kpop idols, but as normal students that question her actions.
We also see a part where the members of NewJeans are actually normal people. 


[MEANING]

Ditto is inspired by a Korean movie about two students in the same school, one in 1979, the other in 2000, that are somehow able to talk to each other using amateur radio.
Now lets make a quick dictionary search, what does the word ditto mean? The meaning of ditto is the same thing again, now lets check the lyrics. 

""Stay in the middle
Like you a little, don't want no riddle
ÎßêÌï¥Ï§ò, say it back, oh, say it, ditto
ÏïÑÏπ®ÏùÄ ÎÑàÎ¨¥ Î©ÄÏñ¥, so say it, ditto""
NewJeans is telling Heesoo to say it back over and over again. Say what back exactly? That Heesoo really likes the feeling that she has kpop idols as friends, but she has to forget that they are not actually idols nor her friends. She wants to get over that fact, but her mind is telling her to say it again and again. 

Now if you do remember at the ending of each MV there is a deer which is taking the role of NewJeans. But what does a deer symbolize? A deer symbolizes grace and devotion. In Heesoos mind we can see the love, loyalty and enthusiasm that she has for her idols and her idols have for her and she is upset about the fact that they are not together and happy.

757,NewJeans,221222 Ditto MV Fan Theory,"Repost due to title error

In the MVs, it‚Äôs clear that not everything is happening in chronological order. Still, I think it‚Äôs clear that them in HS and when the Heesoo is watching the VHS Tape is a long time apart (presumably at least a decade). I don‚Äôt think that New Jeans were ever real.

At 2:29, in Ditto (side b) the screen is static. The tape is unlabeled, and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be evidence of the girls being alive ever elsewhere.

The theory that the plot alludes to the relationship between a fan and their idols is so beautiful, and I think it true. I think more so, I want to share my idea on the literal way they portrayed this meaning. So while I agree that that meaning is there, I think the story has another side based on mental health.

This is mostly opinion and assumption based. Here is my theory and explanations.

I think Heesoo is schizophrenic. Her recording things, documenting them even though they aren‚Äôt real feels like maybe it was maybe something she did to show people her delusions were real. Then after a while maybe she did it to capture and indulge in her delusions.

On the subject of bullying, I think she was severely ostracized, but we when we see her recording nothing, her classmates seemed scared. Not agree or annoyed. Witnessing this especially as a underaged peer, can be very alarming.

With Hyunwook, she often drifts from New Jeans to him. I think it symbolizes breaking from NJ allows room for him/others in the real world. I think he is real because she begins to ignore New Jeans. It wasn‚Äôt easy for her, and much later, she falls seeks out the delusion again.

They were the group who protected me from all the difficulties in life. I was following their activities and updates every second and knew everything about them. Their vlogs and albums indeed saved my life.

I grew up over time, gained new interests and totally forgot about them mid 2020. I did not follow them anywhere since then and knew about their new releases at least half a year after. I sold all of my merch. I forgot them just like the girl at the end of MV did about NewJeans.

It brought so many locked memories. I cannot stop sobbing even now. I miss it a little too much. I even promised never leave their side, but here we are: I am an adult and yes, they were just a period after all‚Ä¶

790,NewJeans,221219 Music Analysis of Ditto,"I am utterly obsessed with Ditto, and even more loved different elements I heard in it (or at least I think I did). There was influence from of Baltimore Club Music (the genre), but I heard a lot of influence from 00s K-indie Coffee Shop music and K-Indie Pop from the late 10s. 

Baltimore Club Music - I‚Äôm not super familiar with the genre, so I won‚Äôt dive too deep into the topic, but the influence it has over the composition and music overall is the complexity that stays consistent throughout the whole song.

00s-10s K-Indie Coffee Shop - The talk-y, breath-y, ethereal vibe in the vocals is VERY K-indie. Think 10cm, Adult Child, Blue Dawn, Autumn Vacation. It feels like they took the vocal guidance from that time and music mixed with the composition of the music tract to create this soothing and addictive upbeat song. K-indie Pop - It reminded me of Baek Ayeon and Lee Jinah‚Äôs musical styling as well. They pull a lot from the K-indie of the 00s, but also have created more upbeat, fresh versions of it. 

Ditto was an incredible and original song. I‚Äôll link songs from the latter two genres bellow.

811,NewJeans,Feeling vindicted - this one goes out to my Hype Boy agkaes,"So a couple months ago I made a post in this subreddit saying that I feel like if New Jeans released Hype Boy first, it would've gotten the same attention that ""Attention"" did. This is because even though I love Attention, Hype Boy is just kinda addictive, so I felt like Knetz thought Attention was the title track and ran with it. 

Most people agreed with me but some people didn't  (not bad, we love differing opinions). Well, looky here everyone, Hype Boy top 2 on all charts FOUR MONTHS LATERüéâ I feel very much vindicated about this.

This is because even though I love Attention, Hype Boy is just kinda addictive, so I felt like Knetz thought Attention was the title track and ran with it. 

Most people agreed with me but some people didn't  (not bad, we love differing opinions). Well, looky here everyone, Hype Boy top 2 on all charts FOUR MONTHS LATERüéâ I feel very much vindicated about this.

843,NewJeans,A message to my fellow Bunnies ahead of Newjean's first comeback...,"I've seen so much negativity towards Newjeans already on others Reddit subs since the teasers started yesterday. The hatred agenda is still alive. I often see the same users complaining about everything related to them while turning a blind eye to other groups when it comes to age-related topics. 

I know that they aren't the only group that gets hate or criticism because success is a double sword for everyone. The easy target of the haters is always the popular ones in the industry. As Taylor Swift once said: ""People throw rocks at things that shine"".

I do understand all the criticism relate to Cookie lyrics but since the haters got one concrete thing to point out they are always pushing an unfair narrative, problematizing absolutely anything about Newjeans based on subjective assumptions. They're always like: ""But the intention..."", ""But the feeling..."" ""but, but but but..."".

 The Ador's statement was really defensive but at the same time they push the narrative that the ""problem"" was only a matter of point of view (which it's not a lie at all since we saw many idols posting about Cookie which shows that for them it was a normal song with unproblematic lyrics), they still apologized for the ones that felt uncomfortable with the lyrics. **OBSERVATION:** I personally understand the criticism cause I do think the lyrics weren't appropriate for them. The best part to me though was that the statement pointed out all the hypocritical narratives towards Newjeans which showed me that the team is aware of everything that has been said about them. 

**Basically, what I'm trying to say is:**  I'm sure none of you are idiots. We can clearly see when some things needed to be addressed and when it's only hatred in disguise. I hope we can all enjoy the comeback focusing on the bright side. They're an amazing group as for now the girls seem to be really nice and I'm loving the concept direction they're going for. The haters will complain about everything so be ready for it and don't let it affect you unless there's something we can't ignore again.

859,NewJeans,What I hope the most for NewJean's future,"NewJeans are coming back soon with another release, and I'm really looking forward to it. Their music is all I listen to these days. I do have one wish for them, though: that is to ensure every single member has their moment in the¬†spotlight and is¬†not overshadowed no matter the concept.

I was watching the ""Attention"" MV, and I noticed how people in the comment section were praising their fairly distributed lines and screentime. It made me realize why it was so easy for me to care and learn about each member. They are a unified group of girls with great chemistry, yet their individuality still shines because they were each given the opportunity to tell their own story. But then there was one comment that basically said how it's not going to be like this going into the future and that they will decide lines and screentime based on the public's opinion of the members.

I'm not saying that the comment is 100% correct, but with what we've witnessed with other girl groups, it might be a possibility. That realization alone made me feel down. NewJeans is perfect the way they are. They are a team; to me, they represent friendship.

I'm not against one member having a moment to showcase their dance or singing skills but I don't want a situation where HYBE or ADOR promote the group by only pushing the ""popular"" member to the point where people start recognizing the group with one face. Right now, the company is doing a good job with how they are promoting their groups. I don't want a ""member 1 ft. Newjeans"" or ""Member 1 and friends"".

The group can do any project they want or go in a totally different direction, as long as they maintain the unity of the group, because I think that is what makes them special and what will make them very successful.",0.92,"What I hope the most for NewJean's future NewJeans are coming back soon with another release, and I'm really looking forward to it.

Did you guys know some cute and informative video that can help me to knowing them and their personalities better and especially help me to learn differentiate them?

I guess I can always see the official content  (and i will when i will have more time) but I really like to see a good compilation video that has the object to help you know them specifically?

What do you think this stage will look like? Is it going to be one singular all-team performance ([like this 3rd gen gg collab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P3rZOmau-g)) or a medley of multiple stages?

I've seen a couple clips of Stray Kidz supporting New Jeans, but I found it odd that Twice ( a group you ""could"" argue is in slight competition with New Jeans) is the only group heavily supporting New Jeans since they debuted. Practically every chance they get in interviews or in public they are lavishly praising new jeans and New Jeans is obviously so grateful and happy as well.

Just something I was wondering especially because you don't see this type of support from other very successful girl groups like BP as well right now in KPop. Speaks a lot about Twice's character..",0.35,"Why is Twice the only group heavily supporting New jeans?

In the survey, 200 industry workers, including employees of entertainment companies and broadcasting companies, film and broadcast content producers, and entertainment reporters, participated in the survey. The results of the survey are presented by sector. \[Editor's Note\]**

'Min Heejin Power' was also valid this time. The momentum of the up-and-coming NewJeans of ADOR under Hybe was amazing. Without the teasing stage, the debut album title song 'Attention', 'Hype Boy', and 'Cookie' first released the music videos of three songs, and then the members were introduced. The public cheered for the flow that broke the mold. The same goes for the 'Best Rookie of the Year' category. NewJeans power continued.

It was natural for New Jeans' name to be ranked first in the '2022 Best Rookie of the Year' section of a survey commemorating the 18th anniversary of the founding of JoyNews24. New Jeans received 104 votes in the '2022 Best Rookie' category, swept over half of the votes, and took first place.

In this regard, NewJeans gave their impressions of winning the rookie of the year selected by 200 entertainment officials through their agency, ADOR. New Jeans said, ""It is unbelievable and an honor to be selected as the rookie of the year No.1. We are happy that many people like our music, and as we received a lot of love in 2022, we will show many more diverse and new challenges in the future. Please look forward to it."".

What is the reason New Jeans' music is loved so much regardless of gender or generation? NewJeans said, ""I think it's because our music has a different charm from the songs that have been released so far."" ""I think people of all ages like it because it has a natural yet new, new and familiar feeling. Also, the lyrics, melody, and beat I think the various emotions that are conveyed make me want to hear it more often.‚Äù

In addition, NewJeans said, ""Please look forward to the various images and music that we will show you in the future, and in the future, we will do our best to make music that fans can enjoy."" They asked listeners and fans to show affection.

**Ive, Le SSerafim, Nmixx, and Kepler, 4th generation girl groups are mentioned in large numbers**

IVE was second in 'Rookie of the Year' after NewJeans. Starship girl group IVE received a total of 75 votes and ranked second overall. IVE, who rose to the top rank at once thanks to the successive successes of 'Love Dive' and 'After Like' this year, was also ranked 2nd in Rookie of the Year, proving its all-time popularity.

In addition, Le Sserafim, who has established itself as a next-generation girl group trend by announcing 'Pearless' and 'Antifragile', also received 12 votes and ranked third.

Next, 'JYP Rookie' Nmixx and 'Girls Planet 999' project group Kepler each received two votes, and other members Hwang Woo-rim, BB, Lee Moo-jin (G)I-DLE, received votes even though they were not newcomers who debuted this year, attracting attention. While girl groups swept 200 votes in 2022, boy groups that debuted in 2022 did not receive even a single vote.
